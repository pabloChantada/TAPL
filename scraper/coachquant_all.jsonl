Define $E_{2}$ as the expected steps when $2$ side lengths away from the start, and $E_{3}$ as the expected steps from the vertex diagonally opposite the start.

Each participant is labeled from $1$ to $50$. If any two participants face off, the one with the higher number wins. Two participants are selected randomly, and the one who loses is eliminated from the competition. The winner continues to the next round, where they are randomly paired with another opponent. This sequence continues until only one participant remains (a total of $49$ rounds are required). Determine the chance that participant $49$ remains in the competition after the first $10$ rounds are complete. ", "problem solution": "We begin by noticing that since any match is won by the higher--numbered player, participant $49$ can only lose if he ever faces participant $50$. In other words, during the first $10$ rounds (which eliminate $10$ players), participant $49$ will definitely survive provided that he does not encounter participant $50$.  A very useful way to view this tournament (often called a \"king--of--the--hill\" process) is to imagine a random permutation of the $50$ players that determines the order in which they appear to play. Specifically, one may think of the tournament as follows:  – In round $1$, the first two players in the permutation, say $\\pi(1)$ and $\\pi(2)$, play a match; the winner is the one with the higher number.  – In each subsequent round, the current \"champion\" (the highest--numbered player encountered so far) plays the next player in the permutation.  After $10$ rounds, exactly the first $11$ players in this order have been involved in a match, while the remaining $39$ players have not yet played and are safe so far.  Thus, participant $49$ remains after $10$ rounds provided one of the following holds:  1) Participant $49$ has not played in the first $10$ rounds, which happens when his position $b$ in the permutation is at least $12$, i.e. $b > 11$.  2) Participant $49$ does play in the first $10$ rounds (so $b \\le 11$) but participant $50$ has not appeared among the first $11$ positions – that is, if $\\pi(1)$, \\dots, $\\pi(11)$ do not include $50$.  Let $b$ be the (random) position of player $49$ and $a$ be the position of player $50$ in the permutation. Since all orders are equally likely, we have:  – $P(b > 11) = \\frac{50-11}{50} = \\frac{39}{50}$.  – $P(b \\le 11) = \\frac{11}{50}$, and given that $b \\le 11$, player $50$ must appear in one of the remaining $50-1 = 49$ positions. The chance that $a > 11$ is $\\frac{50-11}{49} = \\frac{39}{49}$.  Thus, the probability for case (2) is $\\frac{11}{50} \\cdot \\frac{39}{49}$. Adding the two cases, we obtain:  $P(49; survives) = \\frac{39}{50} + \\frac{11}{50} \\cdot \\frac{39}{49} = \\frac{39}{50} + \\frac{429}{2450}$.

From Slippery Ladder I, we know that $y' = -3$ at this point.

A systematic way to do this without overcounting is to use inclusion–exclusion.  Define the following events:  $A$: positions $1$–$3$ are ones,  $B$: positions $2$–$4$ are ones,  $C$: positions $3$–$5$ are ones.   Then, our desired event is $A\\cup B\\cup C$. The total number of outcomes is $6^5 = 7776$.   First, count the size of each event individually:  $|A|$: if positions $1$, $2$, $3$ are ones, the remaining $2$ positions can be any number, giving $6^2 = 36$ outcomes.  Similarly, $|B| = 36$ and $|C| = 36$.   Next, count the intersections:  $A\\cap B$: For both $A$ and $B$ to occur, positions $1$–$4$ must be ones (since $A$ gives $1,2,3$ and $B$ gives $2,3,4$), while position $5$ is free. Thus, $|A\\cap B| = 6$.  $B\\cap C$: Here, positions $2$–$5$ must be ones (from $B$ and $C$), and position $1$ is free, so $|B\\cap C| = 6$.  $A\\cap C$: For both $A$ and $C$ to occur, positions $1$–$3$ and $3$–$5$ are ones, which forces all positions $1$–$5$ to be ones. Therefore, $|A\\cap C| = 1$.   The triple intersection $A\\cap B\\cap C$ also forces all five throws to be ones, so $|A\\cap B\\cap C| = 1$.   Now, by the principle of inclusion–exclusion we have:  $|A \\cup B \\cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\\cap B| - |B\\cap C| - |A\\cap C| + |A\\cap B\\cap C|$.

Bayes' Theorem provides: $P(U|H)=\\frac{P(H|U)P(U)}{P(H)}$.  1. Determine $P(H|U)$:  This is the likelihood of obtaining $10$ heads in succession if the coin is the biased one.  Since a biased double-headed coin always shows heads, $P(H|U)=1$.  2. Determine $P(H)$:  This is the likelihood of obtaining $10$ heads in succession with any coin.

If you release an egg from below story $X$, it will remain intact; otherwise, it will shatter.  From level $(1-n)$ onward, the eggs will break when dropped.  What is the greatest possible value of $n$ such that you need at most $9$ drops to pinpoint $X$ in the worst case?", "problem solution": "We solve the problem using the standard egg‐drop recurrence.  In general, with $k$ eggs and $d$ drops the maximum number of floors that can be tested is $f(k,d)=\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\binom{d}{i}$.  For $3$ eggs and $9$ drops, we have $f(3,9)=\\binom{9}{1}+\\binom{9}{2}+\\binom{9}{3}=9+36+84=129$.  Thus, with $3$ eggs and $9$ drops we can determine the threshold among $129$ floors, meaning that if we number the floors starting at $1$, we are able to decide for floors $1$ up to $129$.  Notice the structure of the problem: an egg remains intact if dropped from any floor at or below $X$, but breaks from any floor above $X$.  Once we have identified that the egg does not break up through floor $129$, then by the problem's wording the very next floor, namely floor $130$, is where the egg will break.  Let us briefly explain the idea behind the dropping sequence that attains this optimum.  Suppose we denote the drop floors by $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_9$.  The plan is to choose these floors such that if the egg breaks on the $i$th drop, the remaining $2$ eggs and the $9-i$ drops left are sufficient to test all floors in the interval below $a_i$.  For $2$ eggs the maximum number of floors that can be checked in $t$ drops is given by the formula $\\frac{t(t+1)}{2}$.  Hence, if an egg breaks on the first drop (at floor $a_1$), we must have $a_1 - 1 \\le \\frac{8\\cdot9}{2} = 36$, which implies $a_1 = 37$.  If the egg survives the drop from $a_1$, then on the second drop we go to floor $a_2 = a_1 + \\left(\\frac{7\\cdot8}{2} + 1\\right) = 37+(28+1) = 66$.  Continuing in this manner, the drops are done from the floors: $a_1 = 37,  a_2 = 66,  a_3 = 88,  a_4 = 104,  a_5 = 115,  a_6 = 122,  a_7 = 126,  a_8 = 128,  a_9 = 129$.  To explain one more step: if the egg breaks on the third drop from floor $a_3 = 88$, then we still have $6$ drops left and $2$ eggs.  The maximum number of floors that can be checked with $2$ eggs in $6$ drops is $\\frac{6\\cdot7}{2} = 21$, which exactly covers the gap between $a_2+1 = 67$ and $88$.  Thus, if an egg survives all drops up to $a_9 = 129$, we know that all floors up to $129$ are safe and by the problem condition the egg will break from floor $130$.  In other words, $129$ floors can be tested and the breaking floor is determined between floor $129$ (safe) and floor $130$ (breaks).  Therefore, the greatest possible value of $n$ is $n = 129 + 1 = 130$.  In our rewritten explanation we have carefully constructed the dropping sequence so that in the worst-case scenario no extra drop is required beyond the allotted $9$.  This addresses the earlier oversight where a final unnecessary step was proposed.  Hence, $n = 130$ is the correct answer.", "valid answer": "130", "problem tags": ["Games", "Brainteasers"], "problem difficulty": "Hard", "problem hint": "Consider using the recurrence $f(k,d)=\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\binom{d}{i}$ to compute the number of floors that can be tested.", "problem firm": ["Akuna Capital", "Transmarket Group", "Worldquant"], "question id": "99506152529407135170"}}

If the egg survives a drop from the $(2N-1)$-th floor, $N-2$ drops remain.   Thus, we can only increase by $N-2$ floors for the first egg, as the second egg can cover $N-3$ floors if the first egg fails.

Hence, this case has a probability of $5 \\cdot \\dfrac{5}{6} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{6^4}$.  Finally, if exactly $3$ dice show a $6$, then the sum of the highest three dice is $18$ regardless of the outcomes of the other two dice. There are $\\binom{5}{2}$ ways to choose which two dice are not $6$, each contributing a probability of $\\left(\\dfrac{5}{6}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{6^3}$.  Adding these mutually exclusive events gives the total probability:  $\\dfrac{1}{6^5} + \\dfrac{25}{6^5} + \\dfrac{250}{6^5} = \\dfrac{276}{6^5} = \\dfrac{23}{648}$.  Thus, the probability that the total of the highest three dice equals $18$ is $\\dfrac{23}{648}$.

The first method involves counting each possible scenario where the first roll is smaller than the second roll.  The second method first calculates the probability of differing rolls and then assesses the chance of the first roll being strictly less than the second. $\\\\$ $\\textbf{Solution 1}$ When a fair 6-sided die is rolled twice, there are $6$ potential results for the first roll and $6$ possible results for the second roll, resulting in a total of $6 \\times 6 = 36$ possible outcomes for both rolls.  A favorable outcome is one where the first roll's value is less than the second roll's.  Enumerating these outcomes, we have:  1. If the initial roll is $1$, the subsequent roll could be $2, 3, 4, 5,$ or $6$.  2. If the initial roll is $2$, the subsequent roll could be $3, 4, 5,$ or $6$.  3. If the initial roll is $3$, the next roll could be $4, 5,$ or $6$.  4. If the first roll is $4$, the next roll could be $5$ or $6$.  5. If the first roll is $5$, the next roll could be $6$.  6. If the first roll is $6$, no favorable outcomes exist.  Summing all favorable outcomes gives $5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15$.

Distinct roll results: The two rolls must differ for one to be smaller than the other.

Assume that on the bus, $y$ of the $50$ individuals are grown-ups (and hence $50-y$ are not).  Therefore, after the bus arrives, the total number of attendees is $x+50$ and the total number of grown-ups is $\\frac{5}{12}x + y$.  The new fraction of grown-ups is given to be $\\frac{11}{25}$; hence we have the equation $\\frac{\\frac{5}{12}x + y}{x+50} = \\frac{11}{25}$.  Multiplying both sides by $(x+50)$ gives $\\frac{5}{12}x + y = \\frac{11}{25}(x+50)$.  Isolating $y$, we obtain $y = \\frac{11}{25}(x+50) - \\frac{5}{12}x$.

Since $y$ must be an integer between $0$ and $50$ (because there are $50$ individuals on the bus), the numerator $7x+6600$ must be divisible by $300$.  In addition, note that the initial grown-up count $\\frac{5}{12}x$ must be an integer, so $x$ must be divisible by $12$.  The condition that $7x + 6600$ is divisible by $300$ is equivalent to $7x \\equiv -6600 \\pmod{300}$.  Because $6600$ is divisible by $300$ ($6600 = 22 \\times 300$), this simplifies to $7x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{300}$.  Since $7$ and $300$ are relatively prime, it follows that $x$ must be divisible by $300$.  Taking the smallest possible positive value that is a multiple of both $12$ and $300$, we choose $x = 300$.  Then the initial number of grown-ups is $\\frac{5}{12} \\times 300 = 125$.  For completeness, one may also compute $y$ to ensure it is a valid number between $0$ and $50$: $y = \\frac{7 \\times 300 + 6600}{300} = \\frac{2100 + 6600}{300} = \\frac{8700}{300} = 29$, which is acceptable.

Note that if a deck contains no aces, the other deck is considered faster, and ties are ignored, meaning no winner.", "problem solution": "To decide which deck to choose, we must compare both the likelihood of a deck containing at least one ace and the expected position of the first ace if the deck does include one.  Let us denote by $P_n$ the probability that a deck of $n$ cards contains at least one ace.  Since there are $4$ aces in a $52$-card deck and the cards are randomly distributed, we have for a deck with $n$ cards  $P_n = 1 - \\frac{\\binom{52-4}{n}}{\\binom{52}{n}} = 1 - \\frac{\\binom{48}{n}}{\\binom{52}{n}}$.  For the $13$-card deck, this probability is  $P_{13} = 1 - \\frac{\\binom{48}{13}}{\\binom{52}{13}}$.  For the $39$-card deck, similarly,  $P_{39} = 1 - \\frac{\\binom{48}{39}}{\\binom{52}{39}}$.  A short calculation (or approximation) shows that $P_{13}$ is substantially lower than $P_{39}$ because the smaller deck has a higher chance of containing no ace at all.  In fact, one may approximate by noting that the expected number of aces in a deck of $n$ cards is $4\\cdot \\frac{n}{52}$.  Thus, for the $13$-card deck the expected number is about $1$, while for the $39$-card deck it is about $3$.  This is critical because if a deck contains no aces, the rule states that its owner loses automatically (the other deck is considered faster).  Even if the $13$-card deck, when it does contain an ace, might allow you to draw fewer cards on average (since fewer cards means a lower average position for the ace), this advantage is outweighed by the relatively high probability of the $13$-card deck having no ace at all.  While one could further analyze the expected draw count when an ace is present by noting that, given $r$ aces in a deck of $n$ cards, the expected position for the first ace is approximately $\\frac{n+1}{r+1}$, the decisive factor in this game is the near certainty that the $39$-card deck will contain at least one ace.  The $13$-card deck, on the other hand, suffers from a non-negligible risk of containing no aces, which guarantees a loss.  Therefore, to maximize your chances of winning, you should choose the deck with $39$ cards.", "valid answer": "39", "problem tags": ["Brainteasers"], "problem difficulty": "Medium", "problem hint": "Calculate the probability that each deck contains at least one ace using the hypergeometric formula; then compare the risk of having no aces.", "problem firm": ["Two Sigma"], "question id": "71760042326136960804"}}

", "problem solution": "We can solve this problem using a state‐based approach. Define the following states:  $E_0$: the expected number of additional flips needed when we currently have $0$ consecutive heads.  $E_1$: the expected additional flips needed when we have $1$ consecutive head.  $E_2$: the expected additional flips needed when we have $2$ consecutive heads.  Our goal is to find $E_0$.  Starting from state $0$, on the next flip:  - If we get a head (with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$) we move to state $1$.  - If we get a tail (with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$) we remain in state $0$.  Thus, the equation for $E_0$ is:  $E_0 = 1 + \\frac{1}{2}E_1 + \\frac{1}{2}E_0$.  (Here, the $1$ represents the flip we just did.)  Rearrange to get:  $\\frac{1}{2}E_0 = 1 + \\frac{1}{2}E_1 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad E_0 = 2 + E_1$.  Now, from state $1$ (one head so far), the next flip gives:  - A head (with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$) that moves us to state $2$.  - A tail (with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$) that resets the count to state $0$.  So the equation for $E_1$ is:  $E_1 = 1 + \\frac{1}{2}E_2 + \\frac{1}{2}E_0$.  For state $2$ (two consecutive heads), the next flip:  - If it is a head (with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$) we have achieved $3$ consecutive heads and are done (thus $0$ additional flips).  - If it is a tail (with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$) then the streak is broken, and we return to state $0$.  Thus, the equation for $E_2$ is:  $E_2 = 1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{2}E_0 = 1 + \\frac{1}{2}E_0$.

Devise a method to determine which sphere is of different weight and whether it is heavier or lighter than the rest, all within those three weighings.", "problem solution": "We will present a thorough solution in a proof-like manner.  First, observe that there are 12 spheres and each sphere can be either heavier or lighter than the standard spheres.  Therefore, there are a total of 24 possible cases to detect (12 candidates $\\times$ 2 possible weight deviations).  Each weighing has three possible outcomes (left side heavier, right side heavier, or both sides balanced).  Since three weighings can yield at most $3^3 = 27$ distinct outcome paths, in principle there is enough information to distinguish all 24 cases.  The remainder is to design an explicit weighing scheme that systematically narrows down these 24 possibilities.   Step 1: Label the spheres 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12.  Divide them into three groups of four: A = ${1,2,3,4}$, B = ${5,6,7,8}$, C = ${9,10,11,12}$.   Weighing 1: Weigh A against B.  There are two possibilities:  (1) They balance (A = B).  In this scenario, the distinct sphere is in C.  For the second weighing, we cleverly compare three of group C against any three known-good spheres from A or B (for example, weigh ${9,10,11}$ vs. ${1,2,3}$).  From that second weighing, we track the balance outcome and proceed.  Ultimately, we can choose a final (third) weighing to isolate which sphere in C is off-weight and also determine if it is heavier or lighter.  (2) They do not balance (assume A $\\neq$ B).  In this case, the off-weight sphere is in A or B.  Furthermore, from the direction of imbalance (which side was heavier or lighter), we record the possibilities.  Then in the second weighing, we reorganize some spheres from A and B to swap positions on the scale, while substituting certain known-good spheres, allowing us to deduce precisely which sphere is unusual and whether it is heavier or lighter by analyzing which way the scale tips in weighings 2 and 3.   A Detailed Breakdown:  • If A = B in the first weighing, that rules out all spheres in A and B as the odd sphere.  We then know it is one of 9,10,11,12, but we still do not know if it's heavier or lighter.  By carefully devising the second weighing (for instance, weigh 9,10,11 vs. 1,2,3), we use the outcome of that scale reading to plan the final weighing—perhaps weighing the suspicious sphere against a known-regular sphere—to conclude which of 9,10,11,12 is different and whether it is heavier or lighter.  • If A $\\neq$ B in the first weighing, we know the odd sphere lies in A or B.  We also glean partial information about whether the odd sphere is heavier or lighter by the direction of the imbalance.  A well-planned second weighing (rearranging some spheres in A and B, and introducing known-regular spheres from C if desired) ensures that each of the three possible outcomes differentiates among all leftover possibilities.  After that second weighing, the final third weighing pinpoints exactly which of the eight suspect spheres is odd and whether it is heavy or light.   This approach exploits the fact that $3^3 = 27$ is sufficient to account for 24 potential outcomes (12 different spheres $\\times$ 2 ways it might differ in weight).  Through systematically arranging what is weighed on each side in each step, we identify the one anomalous sphere and conclude whether it is heavier or lighter in just three weighings.   Final Answer: Such a method exists, and these step-by-step weighings guarantee identification of the unique ball and determination of whether it is heavier or lighter within exactly three uses of the balance scale.", "valid answer": "Valid Answers: A specific three-weighing procedure exists, guaranteeing that you can always find the odd ball and know if it is heavier or lighter.", "problem tags": ["Logic Puzzle", "Combinatorics"], "problem difficulty": "Hard", "problem hint": "Divide the spheres into three groups of four.

Since $\\ln(0.99) \\approx -0.0100503$ and $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.302585$, we obtain: $\\log_{10}(0.99) \\approx \\frac{-0.0100503}{2.302585} \\approx -0.0043648$.  Multiplying by $99$, we have: $99 \\log_{10}(0.99) \\approx 99 \\times (-0.0043648) \\approx -0.4321$.  Thus, $\\log_{10} (99^{99}) \\approx 198 - 0.4321 = 197.5679$.

", "problem solution": "Let the original number have $n$ digits and end with $4$.  We can write it as $N = 10m + 4$, where $m$ is an integer with $(n-1)$ digits.  When we move the final digit $4$ to the front, the new number becomes $M = 4 \\cdot 10^{n-1} + m$.  According to the problem, this rotated number is $4$ times the original number, i.e., $4N = M$.  Substitute the expressions for $N$ and $M$: $4(10m + 4) = 4 \\cdot 10^{n-1} + m$.  Expanding the left-hand side gives $40m + 16 = 4 \\cdot 10^{n-1} + m$.  Subtract $m$ from both sides to group like terms: $40m - m + 16 = 4 \\cdot 10^{n-1}$, which simplifies to $39m + 16 = 4 \\cdot 10^{n-1}$.  Isolate $m$: $39m = 4 \\cdot 10^{n-1} - 16$, so $m = \\frac{4 \\cdot 10^{n-1} - 16}{39}$.  Since $m$ must be an integer, the numerator must be divisible by $39$.  We now test successive values of $n$:  For $n=2$: $m = \\frac{4 \\cdot 10 - 16}{39} = \\frac{40 - 16}{39} = \\frac{24}{39} = \\frac{8}{13}$, which is not an integer.  For $n=3$: $m = \\frac{4 \\cdot 10^2 - 16}{39} = \\frac{400 - 16}{39} = \\frac{384}{39} \\approx 9.846$, still not an integer.  For $n=4$: $m = \\frac{4 \\cdot 10^3 - 16}{39} = \\frac{4000 - 16}{39} = \\frac{3984}{39}$; a quick division shows $3984 \\div 39 \\approx 102.154$, which is not an integer.  For $n=6$: $m = \\frac{4 \\cdot 10^5 - 16}{39} = \\frac{400000 - 16}{39} = \\frac{399984}{39}$, and dividing gives $399984 \\div 39 = 10256$, so $m = 10256$.  Thus, the original number is $N = 10m + 4 = 10 \\cdot 10256 + 4 = 102560 + 4 = 102564$.  A final check confirms the result: moving the final digit $4$ of $102564$ to the front yields $M = 4 \\cdot 10^5 + 10256 = 400000 + 10256 = 410256$, and indeed $4 \\cdot 102564 = 410256$.

The four examples are listed as follows:  $WHITE = 000$  $RED = 101$  $BLUE = 110$  $PURPLE = 100$  Notice that all the non–neutral colors (i.e. those other than WHITE) have codes that begin with a $1$.  In addition, a subtle prompt in the overall puzzle description gives us two subscription plan options – one priced at $20$ per month if billed annually and the other at $30$ per month if billed monthly.  A reasonable way to interpret the pattern is to associate the number of activated digits (those set to $1$) with a certain billing option.  In the examples, both $RED$ ($101$) and $BLUE$ ($110$) have two digits set to $1$, while $PURPLE$ ($100$) has only one.  Reading into this, we can conjecture that the option highlighted by a lower $activation$ corresponds to the more economical subscription ($20$/mo billed annually), whereas more activated digits hint at the pricier, monthly–billed option.  $YELLOW$, which by its very nature suggests brightness and optimism, can be seen as pointing us toward a positive, value–oriented choice.  Aligning this intuition with our readings of the provided examples, we assign $YELLOW$ the binary code that is in tune with the $20$/mo billed annually option.

First, label the circle's center as the origin in a coordinate system.  The key opening move is to place the initial coin exactly at the center of the circle.  This placement ensures that the available area around this first coin is symmetrically distributed with respect to the center.  For each move your opponent makes, suppose they place their coin at a point $(x,y)$ relative to the center.  You then respond by placing your coin at the reflected point $(-x,-y)$ with respect to the same center.  Formal Justification: Once the first coin is placed at the center, the circle is divided into pairs of points that are mirror images with respect to the center.  Because your opponent successfully placed a coin at $(x,y)$, there must be sufficient space for its mirror image at $(-x,-y)$, ensuring no overlaps.  By repeating this reflection strategy on every turn, you can always find a valid placement for your coin, achieving a perfect pairing of each move your opponent makes, thereby never running out of space before they do.

You emerge victorious if $HTH$ shows up before $HHT$; otherwise, your companion wins. What is the likelihood that your companion wins? ", "problem solution": "We can analyze the problem by keeping track of the progress towards either pattern using a state-based (Markov chain) approach.  Define the following states:  Let $S_0$ be the starting state (no progress).  Let $S_1$ be the state where the last coin tossed was $H$ (so we have a partial match of both patterns).  Let $S_2$ be the state where the last two tosses are $HH$. Note that $HH$ is the beginning of the pattern $HHT$.  Let $S_3$ be the state where the last two tosses are $HT$, which is the beginning of the pattern $HTH$.  The transitions are as follows:  1. From $S_0$:     - If we get $H$, we move to $S_1$.     - If we get $T$, no pattern is started, so we stay in $S_0$.  2. From $S_1$ (last toss was $H$):     - If we get $H$, our sequence becomes $HH$, so we move to $S_2$.     - If we get $T$, our sequence becomes $HT$, so we move to $S_3$.  3. From $S_2$ (sequence $HH$):     - If we get $T$, the sequence becomes $HHT$, and your companion wins.     - If we get $H$, the last two tosses remain $HH$ (i.e., we stay in $S_2$), because after $HHH$, the longest suffix that matches a beginning of a pattern is still $HH$.  4. From $S_3$ (sequence $HT$):     - If we get $H$, the sequence becomes $HTH$, and you win.     - If we get $T$, the new sequence $(HTT)$ has no nontrivial suffix that is a prefix of either target pattern, so we return to $S_0$.  Let $p_0$, $p_1$, $p_2$, and $p_3$ denote the probability that your companion wins (i.e., $HHT$ appears before $HTH$) starting from states $S_0$, $S_1$, $S_2$, and $S_3$, respectively. Our goal is to compute $p_0$.  Now, writing the equations based on the transitions:  From $S_0$:  $ p_0 = \\frac{1}{2} p_1 + \\frac{1}{2} p_0 $  Rearrange to get $ \\frac{1}{2} p_0 = \\frac{1}{2} p_1 $ so that $ p_0 = p_1 $.  From $S_1$:  $ p_1 = \\frac{1}{2} p_2 + \\frac{1}{2} p_3 $.  From $S_2$:  $ p_2 = \\frac{1}{2} p_2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 $, because a tails finishes the pattern $HHT$ (companion wins) and a heads keeps us in $S_2$.  Thus, $ \\frac{1}{2} p_2 = \\frac{1}{2} $ which implies $ p_2 = 1 $.  From $S_3$:  $ p_3 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{2} p_0 $, since a head gives $HTH$ (your win, probability $0$ for companion) while a tail sends us to $S_0$. Hence, $ p_3 = \\frac{1}{2} p_0 $.  Substitute the results of $p_2$ and $p_3$ into the equation for $p_1$:  $ p_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}p_0\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} p_0 $.  But since $p_0 = p_1$, we have $ p_0 = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} p_0 $.  Solving for $p_0$, subtract $ \\frac{1}{4} p_0 $ from both sides:  $ \\frac{3}{4} p_0 = \\frac{1}{2} $.  Thus, $ p_0 = \\frac{1/2}{3/4} = \\frac{2}{3} $.  Therefore, the probability that your companion wins is $\\frac{2}{3}$.

This can be viewed as a series of conditional probability events, where the appearance of the second odd is dependent on the first having already appeared.  Initially, the chance that the first roll is odd rather than even is $\\frac{1}{2}$, since there is an equal probability for odd and even numbers, necessitating an odd roll.  Once an odd number is rolled, the possibilities narrow down to $5$ outcomes.  If the result is the odd number already rolled, it is ignored.

", "problem solution": "We can solve the problem by considering an embedded Markov chain that records only the outcomes that affect the progress toward either stopping condition. In our analysis the only outcomes of interest are $5$, $4$, and $6$, as all other numbers do not change the state.  Define the state by two pieces of information: (i) the number of 5’s seen so far and (ii) which of the numbers $4$ or $6$ have been observed. Our stopping conditions are:  (1) If we have seen two 5’s (in which case Jenny stops and we consider this a win),  (2) If we have seen both 4 and 6 (in which case Jenny stops without achieving two 5’s, and we consider this a loss).  Since only rolls $5$, $4$, and $6$ affect the process, we can consider the embedded chain where any roll is one of these three outcomes with probability $\\frac{1}{3}$ each. We name the states as follows:  $ A = (0,\\varnothing) $ (no 5’s, neither 4 nor 6 seen),  $ B = (1,\\varnothing) $ (one 5 seen, neither 4 nor 6 seen),  $ C = (0,{4}) $ (no 5’s, only 4 seen),  $ D = (0,{6}) $ (no 5’s, only 6 seen),  $ E = (1,{4}) $ (one 5 seen, and 4 seen),  $ F = (1,{6}) $ (one 5 seen, and 6 seen).  For any state in which both 4 and 6 have been seen (for example, if we transition from $ C $ upon seeing a $6$, or from $ D $ upon seeing a $4$, or from $ E $ or $ F $ when the missing number is observed), the process stops with a loss (win probability $0$).  Similarly, if a second 5 is observed at any state, the process ends with a win (win probability $1$).  Let $p(s)$ denote the probability of eventually stopping with two 5’s (a win) when starting from the state $s$. We now write the equations for each nonabsorbing state, remembering that we are considering only the outcomes $5$, $4$, and $6$ (with probability $\\frac{1}{3}$ each):  1.

From state $ B = (1,\\varnothing) $, the transitions are:     - Rolling a $5$ gives the second $5$ so we win (probability $1$),     - Rolling a $4$ leads to state $E = (1,{4})$,     - Rolling a $6$ leads to state $F = (1,{6})$. Hence,     $ p(B) = \\frac{1}{3}\\cdot 1 + \\frac{1}{3} p(E) + \\frac{1}{3} p(F) $.  3. From state $ C = (0,{4}) $, note that rolling a $6$ would complete the set $ {4,6} $ (loss), while rolling a $5$ moves us to state $E$ and rolling a $4$ (a repeat) leaves us in $C$. Thus,     $ p(C) = \\frac{1}{3} p(E) + \\frac{1}{3} p(C) + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 0 $.     Solving, $ \\frac{2}{3} p(C) = \\frac{1}{3} p(E) $ which gives $ p(C) = \\frac{1}{2} p(E) $.  4. Similarly, from state $ D = (0,{6}) $, rolling a $4$ yields loss, a $5$ moves to state $F$, and a $6$ leaves us in $D$. Therefore,     $ p(D) = \\frac{1}{3} p(F) + \\frac{1}{3} p(D) + \\frac{1}{3}\\cdot 0 $,     implying $ p(D) = \\frac{1}{2} p(F) $.  5. From state $ E = (1,{4}) $, one $5$ is already recorded and $4$ is seen. Now, rolling a $5$ gives a win immediately; rolling a $4$ does not change the state; and rolling a $6$ completes the set $ {4,6} $ (loss). Thus,     $ p(E) = \\frac{1}{3}\\cdot 1 + \\frac{1}{3} p(E) + \\frac{1}{3}\\cdot 0 $.     Solving, $ \\frac{2}{3}p(E) = \\frac{1}{3} $ so that $ p(E) = \\frac{1}{2} $.  6. From state $ F = (1,{6}) $, the similar analysis yields     $ p(F) = \\frac{1}{3}\\cdot 1 + \\frac{1}{3} p(F) + \\frac{1}{3}\\cdot 0 $,     giving $ p(F) = \\frac{1}{2} $.  Now, substitute back into the equations for $B$ and $A$:  From state $B$,     $ p(B) = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{2}{3} $.  From state $C$,     $ p(C) = \\frac{1}{2} p(E) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} $.  Similarly, from state $D$, $ p(D) = \\frac{1}{2} p(F) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} $.  Finally, from the initial state $ A $,     $ p(A) = \\frac{1}{3}p(B) + \\frac{1}{3}p(C) + \\frac{1}{3}p(D) = \\frac{1}{3}\\cdot \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{1}{3}\\cdot \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{3}\\cdot \\frac{1}{4} $.     Compute each term: $ \\frac{1}{3}\\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2}{9} $ and $ \\frac{1}{3}\\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{12} $.  Thus,     $ p(A) = \\frac{2}{9} + \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{2}{9} + \\frac{1}{6} $.     Express with a common denominator (18): $ \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{4}{18} $ and $ \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{3}{18} $. Therefore,     $ p(A) = \\frac{4+3}{18} = \\frac{7}{18} $.

You will toss the coin repeatedly and, after each toss, calculate the ratio $r$, defined as the number of heads divided by the total number of tosses.  Your stopping rule is to continue tossing until, for the first time, $r$ becomes strictly greater than $0.5$ (note that even if $r$ exactly equals $0.5$, you must continue).  At the moment $r>0.5$, you stop and record the final ratio, which can be expressed in the form $a:1$ where $a=r$.  Over many independent rounds of the game, what is the expected value of $a$?", "problem solution": "A careful analysis begins by observing that the rule $r>0.5$ is equivalent to stopping at the first time that the number of heads exceeds the number of tails.  In other words, if we let $h$ and $t$ denote the cumulative number of heads and tails, then we stop at the first time when $h>t$, and (because $h$ and $t$ are integers) the stopping condition must occur with $h=t+1$.  Because the very first coin toss matters, it is natural to split the analysis into two cases.  (In our improved solution the two branches are handled exactly, with the overshoot in the second case computed using the known hitting‐time law of a simple random walk.)  $\\\\$ $\\underline{Case 1:}$ First toss is a head.  If the first toss is a head, then immediately we have $h=1$ and $t=0$.  Since $1>0$, the stopping condition is met immediately and the final ratio is $\\frac{h}{h+t}=\\frac{1}{1}=1$.  This outcome occurs with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. $\\\\$ $\\underline{Case 2:}$ First toss is a tail.  If the first toss is a tail, then initially $h=0$ and $t=1$, so the ratio $r=0$ and we must continue.  From here the process is best described by tracking the difference $d=h-t$.  After the first toss, $d=-1$.  Each head increases $d$ by $1$ and each tail decreases it by $1$.  The game stops the instant that $d$ becomes positive; by the minimal nature of the stopping rule we must have $d=+1$, which implies $h=t+1$.  It is a standard fact in random walk theory that for a walk with step sizes $\\pm1$ starting at $-1$, the first time it hits $+1$ the move is minimal.  More precisely, suppose that (after the initial tail) the process takes an additional $2k$ coin tosses to hit $+1$ for the first time (with $k\\ge1$).  Then if we let H' and T' denote the number of heads and tails in these additional tosses, we must have $H'-T'=2$ and $H'+T'=2k$.  A short calculation shows that $H' = k+1$ and $T' = k-1$.  Including the initial tail, the overall totals at stopping are $h=k+1$, $t=1+(k-1)=k$, so that $h=t+1$.  Thus the final ratio in this branch is $r=\\frac{h}{h+t}=\\frac{k+1}{2k+1}$.  Note that for any finite $k$ this ratio is strictly above $0.5$ (and it converges to $0.5$ as $k\\to\\infty$).  The probability that the random walk (after the first tail) takes exactly $2k$ additional tosses to reach $+1$ is given by a well‐known formula: $P(\\text{additional tosses}=2k)=\\frac{1}{k+1}\\binom{2k}{k}\\frac{1}{2^{2k}},\\quad k\\ge1$.  A (nontrivial but exact) calculation using generating functions or known identities in the theory of Catalan numbers shows that when the overshoot is taken fully into account, the expected ratio in Case 2 is $E\\Bigl(\\frac{k+1}{2k+1}\\mid\\text{first toss tail}\\Bigr)=0.5$. $\\\\$ Putting the cases together:  By the law of total expectation the overall expected ratio is $E[r]=\\frac{1}{2}\\times1+\\frac{1}{2}\\times0.5=0.5+0.25=0.75$.  $\\\\$ Comments on the improvements:  Unlike a naive approximation that might claim that the overshoot in Case 2 is negligible and so the ratio there is nearly $0.5$, we have shown using a proper overshoot analysis that the discrete nature of the stopping rule forces the game to end with $h=t+1$.  After accounting correctly for the distribution of times to absorption (which is given in closed form in terms of Catalan numbers), one finds that the conditional expected ratio in this tail‐initiated branch is exactly $0.5$.  Combining this with the immediate stopping in Case 1 yields an overall expected ratio of $0.75$.", "valid answer": "0.75, $\\frac{3}{4}$", "problem tags": ["Discrete Random Variables", "Games", "Brainteasers"], "problem difficulty": "Hard", "problem hint": "Try splitting the process into two cases depending on the outcome of the first toss.

These must be divided between two drawers in such a way that no drawer is left empty and no marbles remain outside any drawer.  Then, one of the drawers is chosen at random, and a single marble is drawn at random from that drawer.  The objective is to arrange the marbles so that the probability of drawing a red marble is maximized. ", "problem solution": "First, let us introduce notation.  Let the first drawer (D1) contain $r_1$ red marbles and $b_1$ blue marbles, while the second drawer (D2) contains $r_2$ red marbles and $b_2$ blue marbles.  We know: (1) $r_1 + r_2 = 50$ since there are 50 red marbles in total,  (2) $b_1 + b_2 = 50$ for the 50 blue marbles,  (3) neither drawer is empty, hence $r_1 + b_1 > 0$ and $r_2 + b_2 > 0$.  We select a drawer uniformly at random and then pick a marble at random from that chosen drawer, so the probability of obtaining a red marble is: $\\dfrac{1}{2} \\times \\dfrac{r_1}{r_1 + b_1} + \\dfrac{1}{2} \\times \\dfrac{r_2}{r_2 + b_2}$.  Our goal is to find integers $r_1$, $b_1$, $r_2$, $b_2$ that maximize this probability under the constraints above.  A helpful maneuver is to isolate a single red marble in D1, thus $r_1 = 1$, $b_1 = 0$.  Since D1 must not be empty, this choice satisfies that requirement with a single red marble.  Then, because there are 50 red marbles total, we must place the remaining 49 red marbles in D2, and D2 also gets all 50 blue marbles, so $r_2 = 49$, $b_2 = 50$.  This keeps D2 non-empty as well, because it has 99 marbles.  An intuitive explanation for why this arrangement is optimal is that by isolating one red marble separately, we ensure that if that drawer is chosen, we have a certainty of drawing a red marble, thus significantly boosting the overall probability.  Testing other configurations leads to lower probabilities, so having one drawer containing exactly one red marble and the other containing everything else is the best arrangement.  Thus, the formal conclusion is that the configuration that maximizes your chance of drawing a red marble is to put exactly one red marble in one drawer and all remaining marbles in the other drawer.

Observe that $\\mathbb{E}\\biggl(\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\\biggr) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbb{E}(X_i)$, which by linearity equals the probability of rolling a one on any attempt, namely $\\dfrac{1}{6}$.  The same reasoning applies to $\\mathbb{E}(Y_i)$, resulting in $\\dfrac{1}{6}$ as well.  Consequently, $\\sum_{i=1}^n \\dfrac{1}{6} = \\dfrac{n}{6}$, making the second term equal to $\\dfrac{n^2}{36}$.  For the first sum, we separate into two parts: $i=j$ and $i\\neq j$.  This gives: $\\mathbb{E}\\biggl(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n X_iY_j\\biggr) = \\mathbb{E}\\biggl(\\sum_{i\\neq j} X_iY_j + \\sum_{i=1}^n X_iY_i\\biggr) = \\sum_{i\\neq j} \\mathbb{E}(X_iY_j) + \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbb{E}(X_iY_i)$.  Now, handle these sums separately.  $\\mathbb{E}(X_iY_i)$ represents the probability that both $X_i$ and $Y_i$ occur.  For both $X_i$ and $Y_i$ to occur on the same roll $i$, which is impossible, we have $\\mathbb{E}(X_iY_i) = 0$.  Thus, the entire second sum equals $0$.  For the first expectation, it is the probability of both $X_i$ and $Y_j$ occurring.  For this, roll $i$ must show a $1$ and roll $j$ a $5$.  Since $i\\neq j$, this is feasible, and due to independent rolls, the probability is $\\dfrac{1}{6}\\cdot\\dfrac{1}{6} = \\dfrac{1}{36}$.  Therefore, the first sum is $\\sum_{i\\neq j} \\dfrac{1}{36} = \\dfrac{n(n-1)}{36}$.  The $n(n-1)$ term arises because the sum originally had $n^2$ terms, and after excluding $n$ terms where $i=j$, there are $n^2-n$ terms left.  Hence, substituting, we find $\\text{Cov}(X,Y) = \\dfrac{n^2-n}{36} - \\dfrac{n^2}{36} = -\\dfrac{n}{36}$.  A quicker approach utilizes the fact that $X+Y \\sim \\text{Binom}(n,1/3)$, since $X+Y$ counts the number of times either $1$ or $5$ appears, which occurs on each roll with probability $1/3$.  The variance of $X+Y$ is $\\dfrac{2n}{9}$ from the binomial variance formula.  Given $\\text{Var}(X)$ and $\\text{Var}(Y)$ are both $\\dfrac{5n}{36}$ based on the binomial variance formula, and using the sum variance formula, we have $\\dfrac{2n}{9} = \\dfrac{5n}{36} + \\dfrac{5n}{36} + 2\\text{Cov}(X,Y)$.  Solving gives $2\\text{Cov}(X,Y) = -\\dfrac{n}{18}$, leading to $\\text{Cov}(X,Y) = -\\dfrac{n}{36}$.  For the correlation, $\\sigma_X = \\sigma_Y = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{5n}}{6}$ from the previous calculation.  Thus, $\\rho(X,Y) = \\dfrac{\\text{Cov}(X,Y)}{\\sigma_X\\sigma_Y} = \\dfrac{-\\frac{n}{36}}{\\frac{5n}{36}} = -\\dfrac{1}{5}$ using the correlation formula.", "valid answer": "$-\\frac{1}{5}$", "problem tags": ["Covariance", "Discrete Random Variables", "Probability"], "problem difficulty": "Hard", "problem hint": "Think about $\\text{Var}(X+Y)$ for a faster resolution.

Consider the expected monetary gain of one player, say $X$, when $X$ contributes $x$ tokens and $Y$ adds $y$ tokens.

Similarly, $\\frac{y}{x + y}$ and $100 - y$ represent $Y$'s probabilities and rewards.  To determine the optimal $x$, we find the derivative of $E(x, y)$ with respect to $x$.  Applying the quotient rule, we calculate:  1. First, differentiate the initial term: $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\frac{x}{x + y} \\cdot (100 - x) \\right) = \\frac{(100 - x) \\cdot (x + y) - x \\cdot (-(x + y))}{(x + y)^2} = \\frac{-x^2 - 2xy + 100y}{(x + y)^2}.$  2.

Alternatively, the participant can opt to roll again following the same rules.  Assuming the participant uses the best strategy, what is their expected gain?", "problem solution": "We begin by letting $V$ be the expected gain when playing optimally.  Each roll of the die has 6 equally likely outcomes, each with probability $1/6$.  Notice that if a 6 is rolled, the game ends with a gain of 0.  For the outcomes 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, the participant can choose either to stop and take that value or to continue playing for an expected gain of $V$.  The key idea is to identify the threshold value, say $T$, where if the outcome $k$ is at least $V$ (i.e. when $k \\ge V$), it is optimal to stop, and if $k$ is less than that, it is better to roll again.  A natural candidate is to check whether setting the threshold as $T = 3$ works.  Under this strategy:  - If the die shows 1 or 2, the player opts to roll again (yielding an expected gain of $V$).  - If the die shows 3, 4, or 5, the player stops and takes the amount shown.  - A roll of 6 always yields 0.  Thus, the expected gain $V$ is given by the equation:  $V = \\frac{1}{6}(0) + \\frac{1}{6}(V) + \\frac{1}{6}(V) + \\frac{1}{6}(3) + \\frac{1}{6}(4) + \\frac{1}{6}(5)$.

The die starts with a 1 on its top face, and you have 100 moves to accumulate points.  In each move, you may choose one of the following actions:  1. Roll: Roll the die, which replaces its current top face with a uniformly random number from 1 to 20.  2. Take: Add the number on the current top face to your total score. Note that after taking, the die's top face does not change, so you may take in subsequent moves without rolling again.  A common strategy is to commit to a threshold $n$ (with $1 \\le n \\le 20$) before the game begins.  In each block of play, you continue to roll until the die shows a number that is at least $n$.  When you first achieve a roll with a number $\\ge n$, that move immediately both performs the roll and takes (collects) the die's value.  For example, if it takes $R$ rolls in a block to hit the threshold, the $R$th move counts as both a roll and a take, and you then have a total of $101-R$ moves on which you are effectively taking the same die value (because the die's top face remains unchanged after taking).  Your goal is to choose the threshold $n$ that maximizes your expected total score over 100 moves.  With an optimal, rational choice of $n$, what is the expected total score of the game?", "problem solution": "We now explain a corrected and detailed analysis of the strategy.  Step 1. Expected Number of Moves in the Rolling Phase:  Suppose you commit to a threshold $n$ (with $1 \\le n \\le 20$).  In each move where you choose to roll, the probability that the result is at least $n$ is $p=\\frac{21-n}{20}$.  Thus, the number of rolls needed until you first achieve a value $\\ge n$ is geometrically distributed with expected number of rolls $E(R)=\\frac{1}{p}=\\frac{20}{21-n}$.  A key observation is that when the die first reaches or exceeds the threshold, that particular move both involves the roll and immediately collects (takes) the resulting value.  In other words, if the random number of rolls needed is $R$, then you have already collected a score on move $R$, and you have the remaining $100-R$ moves in which you can simply take the same face value repeatedly.  Alternatively, you receive a total of $1+(100-R)=101-R$ takes (with the successful roll's move counting as a take).  Step 2. Expected Value When the Threshold is Met:  When a roll results in a number at least $n$, the outcome is uniformly distributed among the integers $n$, $n+1$, ... , $20$.  Its expected value is therefore $E(\\text{die value}) = \\frac{n+20}{2}$.  Step 3. Expected Total Score from the Strategy:  The total score is the product of the value collected and the number of moves on which that value is taken.  With the successful move included, you receive the value on $101-R$ moves.  Replacing the random waiting time $R$ by its mean (which is valid by linearity of expectation), we get that the expected total score is $\\text{Score}(n) = \\frac{n+20}{2}\\Bigl(101-\\frac{20}{21-n}\\Bigr)$.  Step 4. Optimizing the Threshold $n$:  Since $n$ must be chosen from the integers $1$, $2$, ... , $20$, we compute the expected total score for each $n$.  For example, when $n=18$:  $\\\\$ - The probability of success on a roll is $\\frac{21-18}{20}=\\frac{3}{20}$, so the expected number of rolls is $\\frac{20}{3}$.  $\\\\$ - The number of moves on which you will take is then $101-\\frac{20}{3}=\\frac{303-20}{3}=\\frac{283}{3}$.  $\\\\$ - The expected die value (upon reaching at least $18$) is $\\frac{18+20}{2}=19$.  $\\\\$ - Thus, the expected total score is $19\\cdot \\frac{283}{3}=\\frac{5377}{3}\\approx 1792.33$.  A brief check of the other threshold values shows that the maximum expected score is indeed achieved at $n=18$.  Step 5. Discussion of the Correction:  Note that a subtle off--by--one error appears if one counts the moves incorrectly.  In the original analysis, one might be tempted to subtract the expected number of rolls from 100 moves.  However, because the move in which the threshold is reached both counts as a roll and yields a capture of the die's value, you actually have $101-\\text{(number of rolls)}$ moves in which the value is taken.  This adjustment changes the expected score formula to $\\text{Score}(n) = \\frac{n+20}{2}\\Bigl(101-\\frac{20}{21-n}\\Bigr)$, which, for $n=18$, gives the final expected total score of $\\frac{5377}{3}$.

If you have exactly one opportunity to reroll at your discretion, it is optimal to adopt a threshold strategy: let $T$ be the smallest integer outcome for which you do not reroll.  Since the expected value of any new fair roll is $3.5$, the threshold $T$ must be the smallest integer greater than $3.5$, so $T=4$.  Thus, you keep the first roll if it is 4, 5, or 6, and reroll if it is 1, 2, or 3.  The probability of rolling 4, 5, or 6 is $\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$, and the average of 4, 5, 6 is $\\frac{4+5+6}{3} = 5$.  Hence, this portion contributes $\\frac{1}{2}\\times 5 = 2.5$ to the expected value.  With probability $\\frac{1}{2}$, you roll 1, 2, or 3 and then take the reroll, whose expectation is $3.5$.  That part contributes $\\frac{1}{2}\\times 3.5 = 1.75$.  Summing yields an overall expected value of $2.5 + 1.75 = 4.25$.  Therefore, you would pay up to $4.25$ for the option to roll the die with one possible reroll.  Next, suppose you can reroll up to two times.  We use backward reasoning, noting that the expected value with just one reroll remaining is $4.25$.  Denote the expected value with two rerolls by $E_2$.  We again adopt a threshold, $T_2$, such that you keep your first roll if it is at least $T_2$, and otherwise proceed to use the remaining one-reroll strategy.  Since the one-reroll strategy has an expected value of $4.25$, $T_2$ is the smallest integer exceeding $4.25$, namely $5$.  The probability of rolling 5 or 6 on the first attempt is $\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$, and the average of those two faces is $\\frac{5+6}{2} = 5.5$.  Thus, from rolling a 5 or 6 you get $\\frac{1}{3}\\times 5.5 = \\frac{11}{6}$.

Now, the total probability $p(x)$ of obtaining a total of $7$ in two rolls is the sum of the three contributions: $p(x) = \\frac{1}{18} + \\left(\\frac{1}{15} - \\frac{x}{3}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{25} + \\frac{3x}{5} - 4x^2\\right)$.  To combine the constant terms, we express them with a common denominator. Using $450$ (since $18$, $15$, and $25$ divide $450$):  $\\frac{1}{18} = \\frac{25}{450}, \\quad \\frac{1}{15} = \\frac{30}{450}, \\quad \\frac{1}{25} = \\frac{18}{450}$.  Thus, the constant part is $\\frac{25}{450} + \\frac{30}{450} + \\frac{18}{450} = \\frac{73}{450}$.  Combine the linear terms: $-\\frac{x}{3} + \\frac{3x}{5}$.  With a common denominator $15$, we have: $-\\frac{x}{3} = -\\frac{5x}{15}, \\quad \\frac{3x}{5} = \\frac{9x}{15}$, so their sum is $\\frac{4x}{15}$.  The quadratic term is simply $-4x^2$.  Thus, the probability function is $p(x) = -4x^2 + \\frac{4}{15}x + \\frac{73}{450}$.

Let $E_0$ be the expected additional number of rolls starting from a state where no $5$ has been observed (i.e. we have not yet started forming our sequence). Let $E_1$ be the expected additional number of rolls given that the last roll was a $5$, so that we are waiting for a $6$ to complete the sequence.  From the state $E_0$:  - If we roll a $5$ (with probability $1/6$), we move to state $E_1$.  - If we roll any other number (with probability $5/6$), we remain in state $E_0$.  Each roll counts as one move. Therefore, the equation for $E_0$ is:  $E_0 = 1 + \\frac{1}{6}E_1 + \\frac{5}{6}E_0$  Rearranging gives:  $E_0 - \\frac{5}{6}E_0 = 1 + \\frac{1}{6}E_1$ $\\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{6}E_0 = 1 + \\frac{1}{6}E_1$ $\\Rightarrow E_0 = 6 + E_1$  Now, consider the state $E_1$ (we have just rolled a $5$ and are now hoping for a $6$):  - If we roll a $6$ (probability $1/6$), we have completed the sequence and no additional rolls are needed.  - If we roll a $5$ (probability $1/6$), this roll can start a new opportunity by remaining in state $E_1$.  - For any other outcome (i.e. numbers $1, 2, 3, 4$, which has probability $4/6$), the sequence is broken and we return to state $E_0$.

Alice chooses a coin with head probability $p_1$ and Bob, after seeing that, selects a coin with head probability $p_2$.  The outcomes and payoffs are:  $HH$: probability = $p_1p_2$ and Bob receives $6$.  $TT$: probability = $(1-p_1)(1-p_2)$ and Bob receives $4$.  The remaining outcomes ($HT$ or $TH$) occur with probability $p_1(1-p_2) + (1-p_1)p_2 = p_1+p_2-2p_1p_2$, and Bob loses $5$ (i.e. pays Alice $5$).

For Bob to have a non-positive EV we require:  $4 - 9p_1 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad p_1 \\ge \\frac{4}{9}$.

This is because each generation can be seen as a fresh game with a particular stopping point we aim to reach.  Consequently, our payout should be a function $f(T)$ that we aim to optimize.  Let's determine $f(T)$ now.  If a number greater than $T$ is generated, the value follows a Unif$(T,1)$ distribution, and its expected value is $\\dfrac{1+T}{2}$.  However, the expected cost to generate such a number is $0.02 \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{1}{1-T} - 1\\right)$, because the chance of getting a number at least $T$ in any trial is $1-T$, making the distribution of trials needed to reach a number at least $T$ a Geom$(1-T)$.  The average of this distribution is $\\dfrac{1}{1-T}$.  The additional cost per trial beyond the first is $0.02$, which gives us the equation above.

The deck is shuffled thoroughly, and the cards are distributed one at a time from the top.  For each card distributed, you have the choice to either retain it or discard it.  Discarding any card incurs a cost of $1$.  At the conclusion, you receive a payout equal to the average of the values of all retained cards.  Determine the optimal approach and the expected earnings from this game. ", "problem solution": "A first glance at the problem might suggest that one could use a fixed threshold rule (for example, \"keep all cards with a value at least $k$\") to try to raise the average of the kept cards; one might then be tempted to calculate a payout such as $\\text{Payout} = \\frac{100+k}{2} - (k-1)$, and then optimize over $k$.  However, this reasoning neglects the fact that the game is a sequential decision problem where decisions early on affect the set of cards available later.  In a dynamic programming formulation the state includes not only the number of cards seen but also the set of kept cards (or at least their sum and count) so that the final payout is $\\text{Net payout} = \\frac{\\text{(sum of kept cards)}}{\\text{(number of kept cards)}} - \\text{(total discard cost)}$.  In other words, if we denote the state after some cards have been processed by $(n,s)$ – where $n$ is the number of retained cards and $s$ their total – then the decision to keep or discard a new card of value $x$ must weigh the immediate inclusion (possibly lowering the average) versus incurring an extra discard cost $1$ while potentially waiting for a card that raises the average.  A proper dynamic programming approach would define a value function, say $V(i,n,s)$, for the maximum expected net payoff from the remaining $100-i$ cards when $i$ cards have been processed.  One then needs to compare the two actions (retain or discard) by considering the continuation value.  A key observation, however, simplifies the analysis considerably.  Consider the strategy of retaining every card.  In that case there is no discard cost, and since the deck contains all numbers from $1$ to $100$, the retained average is $\\frac{1+100}{2} = 50.5$.  Thus the net payoff from keeping every card is $50.5$.  Now, examine the possibility of discarding a card.  Discarding incurs a direct cost of $1$.  In order for a discard to be beneficial, the subsequent increase in the average of the retained cards would have to more than compensate for this cost.  Since the maximum value a card can have is $100$, even the best improvements will be fairly limited.  A careful dynamic-programming analysis – which would involve backward induction starting from the last card – shows that there is no stage at which it is advantageous to incur the discard cost.  That is, at every decision point, the expected future improvement in the retained average does not outweigh the immediate penalty of discarding a card.  Thus, the optimal policy is to simply retain all cards.  Under this policy, the final payout is the average of all $100$ cards, which is $50.5$.  We can also express this as $\\frac{101}{2}$.  In summary, while a naive fixed-threshold rule might appear to offer an improvement, a dynamic programming consideration reveals that discarding any card is never beneficial.  Therefore, the optimal strategy is to keep every card and the expected earnings are $\\frac{101}{2}$.

Assume that the river's current flows steadily at $2$ mph and that the friends row at a constant speed in still water.

The distances covered are:  Upstream distance: $3(x-2)$  Downstream distance: $5(x+2)$  They end up 32 miles downstream from their campsite.  In other words, the net downstream distance is the difference between the downstream and upstream distances.  This gives us the equation:  $5(x+2) - 3(x-2) = 32$.

Next, flip a fair coin 400 times and record the total number of heads, calling this total $Y$. What is the probability that $X$ is strictly greater than $Y$?  ", "problem solution": "First, let us identify the relevant distributions. The total $X$ is the sum of 100 independent rolls of a fair six-sided die, while $Y$ is the count of heads in 400 independent fair coin flips.  1) For a single fair die roll, the possible outcomes are 1,2,3,4,5,6, each with probability $\\frac{1}{6}$. The expected value of one roll is $\\mathbb{E}\\text{die} = 3.5$, and the variance of a single roll is $\\mathbb{V}\\text{die} = \\frac{35}{12}$. Because $X$ is the sum of 100 such independent rolls, we get:  $\\mathbb{E}X = 100 \\times 3.5 = 350,$  $\\mathbb{V}X = 100 \\times \\frac{35}{12} = \\frac{3500}{12} \\approx 291.6667.$  2) For $Y$, each coin flip is a Bernoulli random variable that equals 1 with probability $\\tfrac{1}{2}$ (heads) and 0 with probability $\\tfrac{1}{2}$ (tails). Thus, $Y$ follows a binomial distribution with parameters $n=400$ and $p=\\frac{1}{2}$. Its expectation and variance are:  $\\mathbb{E}Y = 400 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 200,$  $\\mathbb{V}Y = 400 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 100.$  3) We are interested in the probability $\\mathbb{P}(X > Y)$. Define the difference $W = X - Y$. Then the expectation of $W$ is:  $\\mathbb{E}W = \\mathbb{E}X - \\mathbb{E}Y = 350 - 200 = 150,$  and the variance of $W$ (because $X$ and $Y$ are independent) is:  $\\mathbb{V}W = \\mathbb{V}X + \\mathbb{V}Y = \\frac{3500}{12} + 100 = \\frac{3500}{12} + \\frac{1200}{12} = \\frac{4700}{12} \\approx 391.6667.$  Hence the standard deviation of $W$ is $\\sqrt{391.6667} \\approx 19.78.$  4) Since $X$ and $Y$ both involve large numbers of independent trials, by the Central Limit Theorem we can approximate $X$ and $Y$ by normal distributions. Thus, $W$ can be approximated by a normal distribution with mean 150 and variance 391.6667. We wish to find $\\mathbb{P}(W > 0) = \\mathbb{P}(Z > -\\frac{150}{19.78})$ where $Z$ is a standard normal random variable. The ratio is about 7.58, and the probability that a standard normal variable exceeds -7.58 (i.e., that $Z$ is greater than -7.58) is extraordinarily close to 1. In other words, using this normal approximation, the probability that the die-sum exceeds the coin-heads-sum is effectively 1.  5) Therefore, the probability that $X > Y$ is approximately 1, to many decimal places.

", "problem solution": "Solution Explanation: We seek the probability that all the even faces $(2,4,6)$ appear at least once before the first occurrence of any odd face $(1,3,5)$.  Since the die is fair, each face has probability $\\tfrac{1}{6}$ per roll.  Observe that the process stops immediately upon rolling an odd number.  Thus, the probability that an initial odd number appears on the $n\\text{-th}$ roll is $\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)^n$, because we must roll even (probability $\\tfrac{1}{2}$) for the first $(n-1)$ times and then odd (probability $\\tfrac{1}{2}$) on the $n\\text{-th}$.  During those $(n-1)$ even rolls, each roll is equally likely to be one of $(2,4,6)$ with probability $\\tfrac{1}{3}$.  We want the probability that all three of these even values have appeared.  The total number of ways to roll $(n-1)$ times from $(2,4,6)$ is $3^{n-1}$.  By the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, the number of sequences of length $(n-1)$ containing all three values is $3^{n-1} - 3,2^{n-1} + 3$.  Dividing by $3^{n-1}$, we get that the probability of all three evens appearing in $(n-1)$ tries is $\\dfrac{3^{n-1} - 3,2^{n-1} + 3}{3^{n-1}}$.  Next, we multiply by the probability $\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)^n$ that the sequence has length $n$ with exactly $(n-1)$ evens followed by an odd, and sum over all valid $n$.  In fact, to see three distinct even values, we need at least $n=4$.  Hence, we sum from $n=4$ to $\\infty$: $\\sum_{n=4}^{\\infty} \\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)^{n},\\dfrac{3^{n-1} - 3,2^{n-1} + 3}{3^{n-1}}$.  One carefully separates this expression into simpler geometric series: $\\sum_{n=4}^{\\infty} \\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)^{n} - 3\\sum_{n=4}^{\\infty} \\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)^{n}\\left(\\tfrac{2}{3}\\right)^{n-1} + 3\\sum_{n=4}^{\\infty} \\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)^{n}\\left(\\tfrac{1}{3}\\right)^{n-1}$.

", "problem solution": "Solution Explanation: First, note there are $\\binom{6}{3} = 20$ equally likely ways to choose which three of the six weights go on one side of the scale (the other three automatically go on the other side).  Because the weight 106 is the largest, let us examine the case in which 106 appears on a particular side (call it side A).

Let the two chosen weights be $x$ and $y$ from the set $101,102,103,104,105$.  That means side B consists of the other three weights.  Let $S$ be the sum of the five smaller weights: $S = 101 + 102 + 103 + 104 + 105 = 515.$  The sum of side B is then $S - (x + y).$  For side A (which has 106) to be heavier, we require $106 + x + y > 515 - (x + y).$  This simplifies to $106 + 2x + 2y > 515,$ or $x + y > 204.5.$  We list all possible pairs $(x,y)$, finding that 8 of the 10 pairs have $x + y > 204.5.$  Consequently, if 106 is on side A, then in 8 of the 10 ways side A is heavier.  By symmetry, if 106 is on side B, that side will be heavier in 8 of the 10 ways.

What numbers should A and B choose to maximize their probability of winning?", "problem solution": "First, note that the probability of rolling a 12 is 0.4, and for each number from 1 to 11 the probability is 0.6/11 ≈ 0.05455. When two players choose numbers, the outcome is decided by which chosen number is closer to the die roll. The decision boundary between the two numbers is the midpoint. For example, if A chooses x and B chooses y with x > y, then the midpoint is (x + y)/2. If the outcome is greater than this midpoint, A wins; if it is less, B wins. \n\nBecause of the heavy weighting on 12, higher outcomes are more likely. If player A picks 12, player B can choose 11 and win whenever the outcome is between 1 and 11, giving B a win probability of 0.6 (and A only 0.4 from the roll of 12). Similarly, if A chooses 11, B’s best response is to pick 10, which would yield A a win probability of only about 45.5%. \n\nA more balanced choice occurs when A picks 10. In this case, B’s best response is to choose 9. The midpoint is then (9 + 10)/2 = 9.5. Therefore, A wins if the outcome is 10, 11, or 12, while B wins if the outcome is 1 through 9. Calculating the probabilities:\n\n- P(roll = 10) = 0.6/11 ≈ 0.05455\n- P(roll = 11) = 0.6/11 ≈ 0.05455\n- P(roll = 12) = 0.4\n\nThus, A’s total win probability is approximately 0.05455 + 0.05455 + 0.4 = 0.5091 (about 50.91%), while B’s win probability is 9 × 0.05455 ≈ 0.4909 (about 49.09%). Any deviation from these choices would reduce a player’s win probability. \n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy is for player A to choose 10 and for player B to choose 9.", "valid answer": "Player A should choose 10, and player B should choose 9.", "problem tags": ["Game Theory", "Probability", "Optimal Strategy"], "problem difficulty": "Medium", "problem hint": "Determine the decision boundary (midpoint) between the two chosen numbers and consider the heavy weighting on 12 to find the best responses for both players.", "problem firm": ["Jane Street"], "question id": "35113934683374353234"}}

For each group we run a race to rank the horses from fastest to slowest.  For example, in Group A we order the horses as $A1 < A2 < A3 < A4 < A5$, where $A1$ is the fastest in Group A.  Similarly, we have group orderings for Groups B, C, D, and E.  This step takes 5 races.  Next, we hold a 6th race featuring the winners of each group: $A1, B1, C1, D1, $ and $E1$.  Suppose the finishing order in this race turns out to be $A1 < B1 < C1 < D1 < E1$.  With this information we conclude that $A1$ is the overall fastest horse.  Now, we need to determine the 2nd and 3rd fastest horses.  Note that some horses can be eliminated immediately.  The groups whose winners finished 4th and 5th in the 6th race (i.e. D and E) cannot have horses fast enough to contend for the top three overall because at least three horses from Groups A, B, and C are already faster.  For the remaining groups, we examine which horses could possibly be in the top three.

At each stop, three-quarters of them step off the bus, and then exactly seven new passengers board. This routine repeats the same way until travel ends. What is the smallest possible whole number of passengers that the bus could have had initially, assuming it must remain a whole number of passengers after every stop for an indefinite number of stops?  (2) Two fair, six-sided dice are rolled. Their outcomes are multiplied together. What is the probability that their product is a perfect square?", "problem solution": "Solution for (1): We seek a nonnegative integer N so that when the transformation $T(N) = (N/4) + 7$ is applied repeatedly (i.e., $T^k(N)$ for k = 1, 2, 3, ...), the result remains a whole integer each time.  In each stop, three-quarters of the current passengers exit (so one-quarter remain, which is $N/4$ if N is the current count), and then 7 new passengers board.  If the requirement is an integer number of passengers for all infinitely many stops, there is no finite N satisfying that $T(N) = (N/4) + 7$ remains an integer forever.  Here is why, carefully reasoned:  1) First Stop Constraint: For $T(N) = (N/4) + 7$ to be an integer, N must be a multiple of 4. Let $N = 4a$. Then $T(N) = a + 7$.  2) Second Stop Constraint: We now check whether $T(T(N)) = T(a + 7) = ((a + 7)/4) + 7$ also remains an integer. That forces a + 7 to be a multiple of 4. Let $a + 7 = 4b$, so $a = 4b - 7$.  3) Third Stop Constraint: Next, $T^2(N) = a + 7 = 4b$, so $T^3(N) = T(4b) = (4b/4) + 7 = b + 7$. To keep it integral upon more stops, b + 7 must be a multiple of 4. Let $b + 7 = 4c$, so $b = 4c - 7$.  4) Infinite Descent: Continuing this pattern for each subsequent stop forces an infinite chain of conditions: c + 7 must also be a multiple of 4, etc. Since we have no final stop specified, the number of stops is unbounded, so you get an unending requirement of remainders that never settles on a single smallest positive integer. The system of repeated constraints does not admit a finite positive N that remains integral under T for infinitely many stops.  Conclusion: As stated, with an indefinite number of stops and the demand that every intermediate passenger count be a whole number, there is no finite initial passengers count that works.  If the problem were to impose a finite number of stops, then a positive solution could exist (one finds the minimum N by working through a finite chain of divisibility conditions). But under infinite repetition, no such minimum number exists.  Solution for (2): We roll two fair six-sided dice and multiply the results. The product is a perfect square precisely when the pair $d_1, d_2$ is one of the following, where each $d_i$ is in $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$.  • (1,1), product = 1  • (2,2), product = 4  • (3,3), product = 9  • (4,4), product = 16  • (5,5), product = 25  • (6,6), product = 36  • (1,4) or (4,1), product = 4  In total, there are 8 favorable outcomes.

Consequently, for both odd n and even n of fair coins, the probability of observing an even number of heads is always $\\frac{1}{2}$.  Now let the coins possibly have unequal bias, with coin i having probability $p_i$ of landing heads.

You can stop at any time and keep your sum. However, if you ever roll a 6, your score is instantly reset to 0 and the game ends. What is the optimal stopping rule to maximize your expected score, and what is that maximum expected value?  ", "problem solution": "We present a formal analysis of this game using the notion of a threshold strategy. We claim that the best plan is to continue rolling unless your total is at least 15, at which point you should stop. We verify this by computing the expected value of stopping at various totals and comparing it to the expected value of rolling again.  1) Let $T$ be a chosen threshold. Our strategy is: if your current total is at least $T$, then stop; otherwise roll again. Define $E(x)$ as the expected value when your current total is $x$, assuming you use this threshold strategy. If $x \\ge T$, then you immediately stop, so $E(x)=x$. If $x < T$, you roll one more time. Each roll has probability $\\tfrac{1}{6}$ of being a 6 (which ends the game with 0 points) and probability $\\tfrac{5}{6}$ of being one of the values 1 through 5, each equally likely. Thus, for $x < T$, we have:  $E(x)=\\frac{1}{6}\\cdot0+\\frac{5}{6}\\cdot\\biggl(\\frac{E(x+1)+E(x+2)+E(x+3)+E(x+4)+E(x+5)}{5}\\biggr).$  However, if any of $x+1,\\dots,x+5$ is at least $T$, we replace the corresponding $E(x+i)$ by $x+i$ (because we stop as soon as we cross the threshold).  2) We numerically compute $E(0)$ for different thresholds $T$. One finds that as $T$ increases from small values, $E(0)$ (the expected score starting from zero) initially grows. Eventually, it stabilizes around a maximum near $T=15$ (and it is essentially equivalent to also choose $T=16$, as the expected gain from continuing at exactly 15 is the same as stopping). The exact calculations reveal that continuing to roll until the total reaches at least 15 yields an expected value of approximately $6.15$.  3) To see why you should stop at or above 15, consider what happens if you are at total 14. The expected value of rolling again is given by:  $\\text{EV}(\\text{roll from }14)=\\frac{1}{6}\\cdot0+\\frac{5}{6}\\cdot\\frac{15+16+17+18+19}{5}=\\frac{5}{6}\\cdot17=14.1667$,  which exceeds 14, so you should continue from 14. But at total 15, the expected value of rolling is:  $\\text{EV}(\\text{roll from }15)=\\frac{1}{6}\\cdot0+\\frac{5}{6}\\cdot\\frac{16+17+18+19+20}{5}=\\frac{5}{6}\\cdot18=15$,  which is exactly 15, making you indifferent between rolling again and stopping. Hence, you may as well stop once you reach 15 or greater. Trying to push your threshold above 15 forces you to continue from 16, but that extra roll from 16 actually lowers your expected value to about 15.83, which is less than the guaranteed 16 if you just stop. Thus, the optimal policy is to stop as soon as your total reaches at least 15.  4) Therefore, the best strategy (maximizing expected score) is to keep rolling until you have a total of at least 15 and then halt. The expected value under this method is about $6.15$.  Therefore, the optimal stopping threshold is 15, and the maximum expected value is approximately $6.15$.", "valid answer": "Valid Answers: Stop once your total is at least 15 (yielding ≈6.15 expected points).", "problem tags": ["Probability", "Expected Value", "Markov Process"], "problem difficulty": "Medium", "problem hint": "Consider using a threshold strategy: at what total do you become indifferent between rolling again and freezing?", "problem firm": ["Jane Street"], "question id": "55199753451573365501"}}

Since each lamp is independently on or off, there are a total of $2^9 = 512$ configurations, and we must count the number of configurations (independent sets) that contain no two adjacent lit lamps.   One systematic approach is to build the grid row by row.  Label the cells as follows:  $a_1 a_2 a_3$   (first row)  $b_1 b_2 b_3$   (second row)  $c_1 c_2 c_3$   (third row)   First, note that within any single row the lamps are arranged in a line; hence, the pattern in a row must not have adjacent 1's.  The independent (or allowable) patterns for a row of 3 cells are:  $A: 000,\\quad B: 100,\\quad C: 010,\\quad D: 001,\\quad E: 101$.   There are $5$ possibilities for any individual row.  However, adjacent rows interact: if a cell in a row is lit, the cell directly above or below it must be off.  We now define the allowed transitions between two consecutive rows.  For two rows (say an upper row with pattern $p$ and a lower row with pattern $q$), the condition is that in every column, if $p$ has a 1 then $q$ must have a 0.   We list the allowed transitions (and count how many possibilities follow each pattern):   1. From row with pattern $A: 000$: There is no restriction on the row below, so all $5$ patterns are allowed.   2. From $B: 100$ (1 in the first column): In the row below, the first column must be 0. Among the $5$ patterns, only those with a 0 in the first column are allowed. These are: $A = 000, C = 010, D = 001$.  Thus, there are $3$ allowed transitions from $B$.   3. From $C: 010$ (1 in the second column): The lower row’s second column must be 0. Allowed patterns are: $A = 000, B = 100, D = 001, E = 101$ (since $E = 101$ has a 0 in the second column).  Total: $4$ possibilities.   4. From $D: 001$ (1 in the third column): The third column in the lower row must be 0. Allowed patterns are: $A = 000, B = 100, C = 010$.  That gives $3$ possibilities.   5. From $E: 101$ (1's in the first and third columns): The lower row must have 0’s in the first and third columns. The only allowed patterns among our list are $A = 000$ and $C = 010$, so there are $2$ possibilities.   Next, we fill the grid row by row.  Let the patterns for row 1, row 2, and row 3 be $p, q, r$ respectively, with the restriction that $q$ must be allowed after $p$ and $r$ allowed after $q$.   For each choice of pattern on row 1 (of which there are 5), we can count the number of ways to choose row 2 and row 3. In summary, the counts work out as follows:   - If row 1 is $A$ then row 2 can be any of $5$ patterns. The total number of pairs for rows 2 and 3 is:  $A:5, B:3, C:4, D:3, E:2$ summing to $17$.   - If row 1 is $B$ then allowed row 2 patterns are $A, C, D$ (totaling $3$ possibilities) and the respective numbers for row 3 (from each pattern) are $5$, $4$, and $3$, summing to $12$.   - If row 1 is $C$ then allowed row 2 patterns are $A, B, D, E$, with corresponding row 3 counts $5$, $3$, $3$, and $2$, summing to $13$.   - If row 1 is $D$ then allowed row 2 patterns are $A, B, C$, with totals $5$, $3$, and $4$ (summing to $12$).   - If row 1 is $E$ then allowed row 2 patterns are $A, C$ with row 3 counts $5$ and $4$, summing to $9$.   Thus, the overall count of valid configurations is:  $17 + 12 + 13 + 12 + 9 = 63$.   Since there are $63$ independent sets (i.e. valid configurations) and $512$ total configurations, the probability that no two neighboring lamps are illuminated is $\\frac{63}{512}$.   This row-by-row dynamic programming (or state transition) approach systematically accounts for all the restrictions imposed by neighboring cells, and avoids the pitfalls of an ad hoc case breakdown.

Let a $\\textit{run of length } k\\textit{ }$ indicate $k$ consecutive Heads in a single sequence of flips.  Denote by $L$ the maximum run of Heads found in one set of 162 flips, and by $M$ the overall maximum when we compare 30 independent copies of $L$ (one for each person).  Formally, $M = \\max(L_1, L_2, L_3, \\ldots, L_{30})$, where each $L_i$ is the maximum run for person $i$.  The distribution of $L$ can be approximated by first computing the expected number of runs of length $k$ in 162 flips.

Under a Poisson-like approximation for small $e(k)$, the probability that at least one such run occurs in a single sequence of 162 flips is roughly $p(k) = 1 - e^{-e(k)}$.

", "problem solution": "First, observe that $10000 = 2^4 \\times 5^4$.  We require the digits of our sought integer to multiply to this value, and each digit must be an integer from 1 through 9.  Clearly, we cannot use zeros (which annihilate the product) nor any digit above 9.  Consequently, we factor 10000 into primes: $10000 = 2^4 \\times 5^4$.  Our goal is to form valid digits by grouping these prime factors.  Because we cannot form a digit 10 or higher (for example, $2 \\times 5 = 10$ is invalid), the factors of 5 must remain uncombined as the digit 5.  However, the four 2's can be distributed into digits that do not exceed 9.  Notice the following:  • If we leave the four 2's as separate digits, we have 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5 (eight digits), which might not yield the smallest possible integer.  • By grouping three of the 2's into an 8 (since $2^3 = 8$) and leaving the remaining 2 alone, we obtain the digits 2 and 8 along with four 5's.  Thus, the digits are 2, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5.  The product is $2 \\times 8 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 10000$.  Many other combinations, such as using two 4's (since $4 \\times 4 = 16$, although note that two 4's do not directly correspond to a valid grouping here) and four 5's, also yield a product of 10000, but the key is to arrange digits in ascending order to form the smallest possible integer.  To find the smallest integer, place the smallest digits to the left.  Comparing the arrangement of digits 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8 with any other valid grouping shows that when arranged in ascending order as 255558, it is smaller than other possibilities like 445555.  Therefore, the least integer with a digit product of 10000 is $255558$.

Determine the probabilities of each possible outcome (team largest+smallest wins, team middle wins, or tie) and the expected value of the payoff.", "problem solution": "We begin by letting the outcomes of the four independent die tosses be denoted by $X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4$, each uniformly distributed over ${1,2,3,4,5,6}$.  For any particular outcome, if we sort the numbers in non‐decreasing order and label them as $a \\le b \\le c \\le d$, we define:  $S = a \\quad\\text{(smallest)}, \\quad M_1 = b, \\quad M_2 = c, \\quad L = d \\quad\\text{(largest)}$.  The two teams are then formed as follows:  $\\text{Team A (largest+smallest) has total } T_A = a+d$,  $\\text{Team B (middle two) has total } T_B = b+c$.  The winning rule is straightforward:  $\\text{Team A wins if } T_A > T_B, \\quad \\text{Team B wins if } T_A < T_B, \\quad \\text{and a tie occurs when } T_A = T_B$.  Note that even though the total sum of the dice, $a+b+c+d$, varies from one outcome to another, our condition compares the two team totals directly; we do not replace the total by its expected value.  In other words, we work directly with the inequality $a+d > b+c$  (Team A win),  $a+d = b+c$  (tie),  $a+d < b+c$  (Team B win).  Since there are $6^4 = 1296$ equally likely outcomes, a complete solution involves counting the number of outcomes that satisfy each of the three events.  A systematic approach is to either:  1) Enumerate the sorted outcomes $(a,b,c,d)$ along with their frequencies (recognizing that some tuples may arise from several dice orders), evaluate $T_A = a+d$ and $T_B = b+c$ for each, and then count how many satisfy $T_A > T_B$, $T_A < T_B$, or $T_A = T_B$.  2) Proceed via a joint distribution of $T_A$ and $T_B$. One might first find the possible values of $a+d$ and $b+c$ and then for each pair count the outcomes where the inequality holds.  A careful enumeration (which may be aided by computer algorithms or a very systematic manual count) shows that exactly 435 outcomes yield $a+d > b+c$ and, by symmetry, another 435 yield $a+d < b+c$; the remaining 426 outcomes satisfy $a+d = b+c$.  Thus, the probabilities are:  $P(\\text{Team A wins}) = \\dfrac{435}{1296} = \\dfrac{145}{432}$,  $P(\\text{Tie}) = \\dfrac{426}{1296} = \\dfrac{142}{432}$,  $P(\\text{Team B wins}) = \\dfrac{435}{1296} = \\dfrac{145}{432}$.  Next, the payoff in any outcome is defined as the positive difference  $\\text{payoff} = |T_A - T_B| = |(a+d) - (b+c)|$.  Again, by summing the absolute differences weighted by their frequency for all 1296 outcomes, one obtains a total sum of differences equal to 2828.  Therefore, the expected payoff is $\\mathbb{E}(\\text{payoff}) = \\dfrac{2828}{1296} \\approx 2.184$.  In summary, after a correct counting (which avoids the common error of replacing the variable total with its average), we have:  $P(\\text{Team A wins}) = \\dfrac{145}{432} \\approx 0.336$,  $P(\\text{Tie}) = \\dfrac{142}{432} \\approx 0.329$,  $P(\\text{Team B wins}) = \\dfrac{145}{432} \\approx 0.336$,  $\\text{Expected payoff} \\approx 2.184$.

For three lengths $a, b, c$ to form a triangle, each side length must be less than the sum of the other two, i.e. $a < b + c, b < a + c, c < a + b.$  Equivalently, in this context, no single segment length should exceed $\\tfrac{1}{2}$ of the original stick's length.

", "problem solution": "We are given that the three numbers in arithmetic progression $a,\\quad a+k,\\quad a+2k$ have a product $a(a+k)(a+2k)=p$, where $p$ is a positive prime.  Since $p$ has only two positive divisors ($1$ and $p$), the three factors must (up to sign) be among ${\\pm1,\\pm p}$.  In order for their product to be $p$, one of the factors must be $\\pm p$ and the other two must be $\\pm 1$, with signs chosen so that the overall product is positive.  One natural way to produce a prime product is to use the triple ${-p, -1, 1}$ (in some order), since $(-p)(-1)(1)=p$.  We now ask: can these three numbers be arranged in an arithmetic progression of the form $a,\\quad a+k,\\quad a+2k$?  There are two possibilities to consider:  1) Suppose we set $a = -p, \\quad a+k = -1, \\quad a+2k = 1$.  The terms must satisfy the arithmetic condition, and indeed the middle term is the average of the first and third since $-1 = \\frac{-p+1}{2}$.

Thus, in this case, $a^2+k^2 = (-3)^2+2^2 = 9+4 = 13$.  2) Alternatively, one might consider the possibility with a negative common difference.  For example, choose $a = 1, \\quad a+k = -1, \\quad a+2k = -3$.  Here, we again have an arithmetic progression because $-1 = \\frac{1+(-3)}{2}$, and the product is $1\\cdot(-1)\\cdot(-3)=3$.  In this case, we determine $k$ from $1+k=-1$, giving $k=-2$, so that $a^2+k^2 = 1^2+(-2)^2 = 1+4 = 5$.  Thus, both assignments yield a product of $3$.  However, observe that the sequence is given explicitly as $a, a+k, a+2k$, and no restriction on the sign of $k$ is stated in the problem.  It is common in many problems to assume the common difference to be positive, in which case the intended solution is the one with $a=-3$ and $k=2$, leading to $a^2+k^2 = 13$.

We let $E_0$, $E_1$, and $E_2$ be the expected number of additional rolls required from each of these states to eventually reach two consecutive sixes for the first time.  Once we reach $S_2$, the event has occurred, so $E_2 = 0$.  From $S_0$, each roll either follows with a six (probability $\\frac{1}{6}$), transitioning us to state $S_1$, or it is not a six (probability $\\frac{5}{6}$), keeping us in $S_0$.

First, the correlation of two random variables $X$ and $Y$ is given by $\\mathrm{Corr}(X, Y) = \\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}(X, Y)}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(X)\\mathrm{Var}(Y)}}$.  Note that $\\mathrm{Cov}(X, Y) = E(XY) - E(X)E(Y)$.  Because $X$ is symmetrically distributed around 0, we have $E(X) = 0$.

Let us begin by recalling a well-known general fact: if $n+1$ points are selected uniformly at random on the surface of an $n$-dimensional sphere, then the probability that these points' convex hull contains the sphere's center (origin) is $\\frac{1}{2^n}$.  In our setting, $n=3$, so when 4 points are chosen on the 2-sphere (the unit sphere in 3-dimensional space), the probability that the center lies inside the resulting tetrahedron is thus $\\frac{1}{2^3}=\\frac{1}{8}$.  To see why more rigorously, label the four chosen points $P1$, $P2$, $P3$, $P4$.  Each point is uniformly distributed on the sphere, meaning all orientations of any configuration of points are equally likely.  One formal way to see that the probability is exactly $1/8$ is to note that for any set of four points, precisely one of the eight possible ways to assign 'orientation directions' (thinking of each triangular face's outward normal vector) will enclose the center.

How many sheep remain? ", "problem solution": "We solve the puzzle by using backward induction on the number of tigers.  Let the configuration with $n$ tigers and $1$ sheep be the state of the game.  The key is to notice that a tiger that eats the sheep transforms into a sheep, but then may become prey if any other tiger decides to act later.  All tigers are logical and will only act if doing so guarantees their survival.  $\\\\$ 1. $\\textbf{Base Case (n=1):} $ With a single tiger and one sheep, the lone tiger has no danger of being eaten afterward.  Therefore, the tiger will consume the sheep, transforming into a sheep.  The final state is one sheep.  $\\\\$ 2. $\\textbf{Case (n=2):}$ Suppose there are two tigers.  If any tiger chooses to eat the sheep, it becomes a sheep.  Then the situation becomes a one-tiger configuration (since now there is one predator left), which by the base case would lead the remaining tiger to consume the newly converted sheep.  In other words, the tiger that acts will eventually be eaten by the other.  Since survival is the primary objective, neither tiger will initiate the action.  Hence, with two tigers, no one eats the sheep and the sheep remains.  $\\\\$ 3. $\\textbf{Inductive Step:}$ Assume the following outcome holds: if there is an even number of tigers, then no tiger will eat the sheep, whereas if there is an odd number of tigers, one tiger can safely act to eventually end with the sheep being consumed (and that tiger surviving as a sheep).  Consider a situation with $n$ tigers.  The decision of a tiger to eat is based on the outcome of the resulting configuration after its action.  When a tiger eats the sheep, it transforms into a sheep and the number of remaining tigers decreases by one.  - If $n$ is odd: When one tiger acts, the remaining number of tigers becomes even.  By our hypothesis, in an even configuration the other tigers will not act (to avoid endangering themselves).  Thus, acting is safe.  Therefore, when $n$ is odd, a tiger will choose to eat the sheep.  - If $n$ is even: If a tiger acts, then the configuration changes to one with an odd number of tigers.  By the inductive hypothesis, a tiger in an odd configuration will act, which implies that the initiating tiger will eventually be eaten.  Therefore, when $n$ is even, no tiger benefits from taking the action, so the sheep remains uneaten.  4. $\\textbf{Conclusion for 100 Tigers:}$ Since $100$ is even, none of the $100$ tigers will initiate eating the sheep.

If a marble belongs to $B$, and $B$ placed $b$ marbles, $B$ receives $100-b$ units.  Assuming both participants use the best possible strategy, determine the expected overall earnings for player $A$.", "problem solution": "We begin by simplifying the rules of the game.  When both players adopt optimal strategies, they will not alter their strategies even if the game is repeated multiple times.  Hence, the best strategy for a game with $2$ marble draws is identical to that of a single draw; we simply double the expected earnings to account for two draws.  Given the game\\'s symmetry, both players will use the same strategy.  This concept is crucial.  Define $A(a,b)$ as the anticipated earnings for player $A$ when $A$ places $a$ marbles and $B$ places $b$ marbles.  For a single draw, $A(a,b) = \\dfrac{a}{a+b} \\cdot (100 - a)$.  This is because player $A$ has a drawing probability of $\\dfrac{a}{a+b}$, with a payout of $100-a$.  Fix $b$ to find which $a$ maximizes $A(a,b)$.  This involves computing the partial derivative of $A(a,b)$ in terms of $a$, assuming $a$ is continuous initially, and adjusting for discrete values later.  The derivative yields $\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial a}A(a,b) = -\\dfrac{a^2 + 2ba - 100b}{(a+b)^2} = 0 \\iff a^2 + 2ba - 100b = 0$.  Solving this using the quadratic formula gives $a^* = \\dfrac{-2b \\pm \\sqrt{4b^2 + 400b}}{2}$.  However, the negative root results in a non-feasible value, so $a^* = \\sqrt{b^2 + 100b} - b$ is the optimal counter for player $A$ if $B$ places $b$ marbles.  Similarly, by symmetry, the best move for $B$ when $A$ uses $a$ marbles is $b^* = \\sqrt{a^2 + 100a} - a$.  To find the best strategy for each player, determine the pair $(a^*,b^*)$ where neither player benefits from altering their strategy.  We know from symmetry that $a^* = b^*$.  Thus, substituting $b^*$ as $a^*$ into the initial equation, we find $a^* = \\sqrt{(a^*)^2 + 100a^*} - a^* \\iff 4(a^*)^2 = (a^*)^2 + 100a^* \\iff a^*(3a^* - 100) = 0 \\iff a^* = 0,\\dfrac{100}{3}$.

Since all outcomes are equally likely (a total of $216$ outcomes), we first count how many outcomes have a given minimum value $x$.  For three dice, the number of outcomes where the $\\text{minimum}$ is exactly $x$ is given by $(6 - x + 1)^3 - (6 - x)^3$.  This formula works because $(6 - x + 1)^3$ counts the outcomes where all dice show at least $x$, and subtracting $(6 - x)^3$ removes those outcomes where all dice show strictly more than $x$.  Let us verify this count for several values of $x$:  For $x = 6$: $(6-6+1)^3 - (6-6)^3 = 1^3 - 0^3 = 1$ outcome, namely $(6,6,6)$.  For $x = 5$: $(6-5+1)^3 - (6-5)^3 = 2^3 - 1^3 = 8 - 1 = 7$ outcomes.  For $x = 4$: $(6-4+1)^3 - (6-4)^3 = 3^3 - 2^3 = 27 - 8 = 19$ outcomes.  For $x = 3$: $(6-3+1)^3 - (6-3)^3 = 4^3 - 3^3 = 64 - 27 = 37$ outcomes.  For $x = 2$: $(6-2+1)^3 - (6-2)^3 = 5^3 - 4^3 = 125 - 64 = 61$ outcomes.

Step 1. Without loss of generality, fix one point, say A, at an arbitrary position on the circle (for instance, at angle 0). Since the circle is symmetric, this does not affect the probability.  Step 2. Let the other two points, B and C, be placed independently and uniformly at random on the circle. Their positions can be described by angles, say $\\theta$ and $\\phi$, each uniformly distributed in the interval from $0$ to $2\\pi$ (excluding $2\\pi$).  Step 3. It is useful to order the positions of the three points along the circle.

Then, start anew by removing the first number in the subsequent cycle, retaining the second, and so on.  Determine the final number to be removed from the circle.", "problem solution": "To solve this problem correctly we must carefully analyze what happens in each cycle.  Notice that the process always begins a cycle by removing the first number from the current circle.  Consider a circle with $n$ numbers.  In the very first cycle, starting at the first number, we eliminate every other number.  That is, we remove the numbers in positions $1, 3, 5, \\dots$.  Observe that:  $1)$ If $n$ is even, the survivors are exactly the numbers in positions $2, 4, 6, \\dots, n$.  $2)$ If $n$ is odd, then the last (odd) number is also removed, leaving survivors in positions $2, 4, 6, \\dots, n-1$.  In either case, the survivors are precisely the even-numbered entries of the list.  If we divide these survivors by $2$, we obtain a new circle labeled $1, 2, \\dots, \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ in their same cyclic order.  Importantly, when the next cycle begins, we again start by removing the first number in this new arrangement.  Thus, if we let $f(n)$ denote the final number removed (in the original scale) from a circle of $n$ numbers, then the process satisfies the recurrence $f(n) = \\begin{cases} 1, & \\text{if } n = 1,  2,f(\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor), & \\text{if } n > 1. \\end{cases}$  This recurrence shows that with each cycle the surviving numbers are exactly twice the final outcome of a smaller game.  It is not hard to prove by induction that the solution to this recurrence is the largest power of $2$ that does not exceed $n$.

Hint: Track the position of $B$ by labeling its position as $i$, where $i=1$ means $B$ is at the top and $i=52$ means $B$ is at the bottom.  Analyze how each move affects this position and derive a recurrence relation that leads to the final expected value.", "problem solution": "We analyze the problem by tracking the position of card $B$.  Label the position of $B$ by $i$, where $i=1$ means $B$ is on top and $i=52$ means $B$ is at the bottom.  Our goal is to compute the expected number of moves needed to have $B$ reach the top (i.e. position 1), starting from $i=52$.  Consider what happens during one move when card $B$ is not on top (i.e. when $i>1$):  1. We remove the top card, which is definitely not $B$. As a result, all cards shift one position upward. Thus, if card $B$ was originally in position $i$, it now moves to position $i-1$.  2. We reinsert the removed card into one of the 52 positions uniformly at random. Now there are two cases for what happens to the position of card $B$:     - If the reinserted card lands in one of the first $i-1$ positions (i.e. above $B$), then the deck gains a new card above $B$ and $B$’s position increases by one, moving from $i-1$ back to $i$.     - Conversely, if the reinserted card lands in one of the remaining positions (i.e. positions $i$ through $52$), then $B$ remains in position $i-1$.  Since the insertion is uniformly random, the probability that the new card is placed in one of the first $i-1$ positions is $\\frac{i-1}{52}$, and in one of the remaining positions is $\\frac{53-i}{52}$.  Let $E(i)$ be the expected number of moves to reach the top when $B$ is at position $i$.  When $i>1$, one move is performed and then the expectation evolves according to where $B$ ends up. Hence, we have the recurrence:  $ E(i) = 1 + \\frac{i-1}{52} E(i) + \\frac{53-i}{52} E(i-1). $  To solve for $E(i)$, subtract $\\frac{i-1}{52}E(i)$ from both sides:  $ E(i)\\left(1 - \\frac{i-1}{52}\\right) = 1 + \\frac{53-i}{52}E(i-1). $  Since $1-\\frac{i-1}{52}=\\frac{53-i}{52}$, multiplying both sides by 52 gives:  $ (53-i)E(i) = 52 + (53-i)E(i-1). $  Dividing both sides by $53-i$ (which is positive for $i>1$) leads to:  $ E(i) = \\frac{52}{53-i} + E(i-1). $  This recurrence shows that to advance from position $i$ to $i-1$, an expected number of moves equal to $\\frac{52}{53-i}$ are required.  Since card $B$ needs to go from position 52 to 1, it must climb 51 steps.  By the linearity of expectation, the total expected number of moves is the sum for each step.  Letting $j = 53-i$, as $B$ advances one position, we have:  $ E(52) = \\sum_{i=2}^{52}\\frac{52}{53-i} = \\sum_{j=1}^{51} \\frac{52}{j} = 52,\\sum_{j=1}^{51}\\frac{1}{j} = 52,H_{51}, $  where $H_{51}$ denotes the 51st harmonic number, $H_{51} = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{51}$.

Next, we count how many of these 70 paths pass through the blacked out middle square.

Therefore, the set is $(a, b, c, d, e) = (1.5, 3.5, 9.5, 9.5, 12.5)$ and $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + e^2 = \\dfrac{3^2 + 7^2 + 19^2 + 19^2 + 25^2}{2^2} = \\dfrac{1405}{4}$.", "valid answer": "Valid Answers: $1405/4$", "problem tags": ["Brainteasers"], "problem difficulty": "Hard", "problem hint": "We can assume an order such that $a \\leq b \\leq c \\leq d \\leq e$.

Note that there are $\\frac{(2n)!}{2^n \\cdot n!}$ ways to pair the $2n$ gloves, since there are $(2n)!$ total permutations, $n!$ ways to rename the pairs, and $2$ ways to reorder each pair.   Let $g_n$ represent the count of pairings that meet our criteria.   Consider the two gloves with label $n$, denoted $n_1$ and $n_2$.   First, select a partner for $n_1$.   Either $n_2$ is paired with $n_1$, reducing the problem to $n-1$ pairs, or $n_1$ pairs with one of the gloves labeled $n-1$, with $2$ choices for that glove.   Consequently, $n_2$ pairs with the other glove labeled $n-1$, which is then determined.   This reduces the problem to $n-2$ pairs.   Hence, the recurrence relation is $g_n = g_{n-1} + 2g_{n-2}$.   The $2$ preceding $g_{n-2}$ signifies the two choices for the glove labeled $n-1$ to pair with $n_1$ in that scenario.   We now establish initial conditions.

When a bookmaker quotes odds of $\\frac{3}{2}$ on Spain to win, it means that for every $2$ units bet, you gain a profit of $3$ units if Spain wins.  In other words, placing a bet of $x$ units at this bookmaker returns a total of $1 + \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{5}{2}$ times your stake (i.e. $2.5x$) if Spain wins.  Similarly, the German bookmaker offers odds of $\\frac{4}{3}$ on Spain to win.  This means that for every $3$ units bet, you gain a profit of $4$ units if Spain wins.  Thus, a bet of $y$ units there would return a total of $1 + \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{7}{3}$ times your stake (approximately $2.333y$) if Spain wins.  In a typical arbitrage situation, a bettor needs odds on mutually exclusive outcomes (for example, one bookmaker offering odds for Spain to win and another offering odds for Spain to lose).  Only then can you split your stake between the two outcomes and guarantee a profit regardless of the result.  Here, notice that both bookmakers are only offering odds on the same outcome – that is, Spain winning.  Without a complementary set of odds on Spain not winning (or another outcome) from at least one bookmaker, the situation does not allow for an arbitrage by hedging across outcomes.  Since if you bet on Spain winning with both bookmakers the result is the same (you win if Spain wins and lose if Spain does not win), no guaranteed profit can be locked in by splitting your bets between the two bookmakers.  Thus, the best strategy, when only one outcome is quoted, is to select the bookmaker offering the higher payout for that outcome.  In this case, comparing the multipliers:  $\\text{Spanish bookmaker multiplier} = 2.5 \\quad \\text{vs.} \\quad \\text{German bookmaker multiplier} \\approx 2.333$  It is clear that the Spanish bookmaker offers a better return.  Therefore, you should place your entire wager with the Spanish bookmaker to maximize your potential profit if Spain wins.  In summary, if both bookmakers offer odds on the same outcome (Spain winning), there is no arbitrage opportunity because you are not covering all possible outcomes of the match.  The correct approach is to choose the bookmaker with the best odds—in this case, the Spanish bookmaker with odds of $\\frac{3}{2}$.

Let $E_n = 0$ because if we already have n consecutive identical results, no more flips are needed.  We are ultimately interested in $E_0$, which is the expected number of flips before any coin has been tossed or when no consecutive match has been established yet.  First, from state i = 0 (meaning no prior flips or no current streak), it takes exactly 1 flip to move to state i = 1. Hence,  $E_0 = 1 + E_1$.  For any $1 \\le i \\le n-2$, if the next toss is the same as the previous streak's result (probability 1/2), we progress from i consecutive identical results to i+1 consecutive results.  If the next toss differs (probability 1/2), then we break the streak and revert to exactly 1 consecutive instance of the new result (not zero, because we have 1 instance of the new outcome).  Thus, for $1 \\le i \\le n-2$,  $E_i = 1 + \\frac{1}{2}E_{i+1} + \\frac{1}{2}E_1$.  Finally, from i = n-1, if the next flip is the same, we achieve n consecutive identical results and finish, so that adds 0 additional expected flips beyond the single toss.

This matches $2^1 - 1 = 1$.  • For n = 2, one can solve via simpler states or direct calculation, finding 3 flips on average. This agrees with $2^2 - 1 = 3$.  • For n = 3, the answer is 7, which follows $2^3 - 1 = 7$.

Between every pair of cities, there is exactly one of two possible types of transportation. Show that among these six cities, it is inevitable to find three cities all connected by the same type of transportation, thus forming a three-city cycle.  ", "problem solution": "We will use a classic result in graph theory known as Ramsey's theorem.  Label the six cities as points in a complete graph of six nodes, where each edge (representing the connection between two cities) is colored according to one of two given modes of transportation.  We need to prove that there is always a monochromatic triangle (a cycle of length 3) among these six nodes.  Formally, Ramsey's theorem in this case states that $R(3,3) = 6$.  This means that if each edge of a complete graph on 6 vertices is colored in one of two colors, there must be a monochromatic triangle.  Here is a direct approach to see why such a triangle must appear:  1. Pick any city, call it A. Since there are 5 edges connecting A to the other 5 cities, by the pigeonhole principle, at least 3 of those edges must be of the same color. Let us label those 3 connected cities as B, C, and D, such that each edge from A to B, A to C, and A to D is of the same mode of transportation.  2. Now examine the edges between B, C, and D themselves. There are 3 edges (one between B and C, one between C and D, and one between D and B). If at least one of those edges is the same color as the edges leading from A, then we have a 3-city cycle of that color immediately (for instance, A-B-C if the edge between B and C matches the color from A to B and A to C).  3.

First, for one-digit numbers (1 through 9), the digits 7 and 8 are disallowed, so the valid digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9, which sum to $1+2+3+4+5+6+9=30$.

Specifically for d = 1, this probability reduces to $\\log_{10}(2)$.  Formal Reasoning:  1. We want the leading digit of $2^n$ to be 1, meaning that $2^n$ must lie in the interval $1.0..., 2.0...)$ when written in decimal representation.  2. Express $2^n$ in scientific notation as $2^n = 10^{\\log_{10}(2^n)} = 10^{n\\log_{10}(2)}$.  3. Let $x = n\\log_{10}(2)$.

Let $E_0$ be the expected total from the start (before any roll).  Let $E_1$, $E_2$, and $E_3$ be the expected additional coins if the last roll showed 1, 2, or 3, respectively.  Because the die's faces are (1,2,3,1,2,3), each of the numbers 1, 2, and 3 appears with probability $\\tfrac{2}{6} = \\tfrac{1}{3}$.  From an unrolled state, the first roll yields 1, 2, or 3 (each with probability $\\tfrac{1}{3}$) and then transitions to one of the states: 1, 2, or 3.  Thus, $E_0 = \\tfrac{1}{3}\\bigl(1 + E_1\\bigr) + \\tfrac{1}{3}\\bigl(2 + E_2\\bigr) + \\tfrac{1}{3}\\bigl(3 + E_3\\bigr)$.  Next, consider state 1: if we roll another 1, the game ends immediately and we receive 1 coin.  Otherwise, we roll 2 or 3 (each with probability $\\tfrac{1}{3}$), earn that many coins, and move into the corresponding new state.  Hence, $E_1 = \\tfrac{1}{3}\\cdot 1 + \\tfrac{1}{3}\\bigl(2 + E_2\\bigr) + \\tfrac{1}{3}\\bigl(3 + E_3\\bigr)$.

How can this be arranged using only unbiased (fair) coin flips? ", "problem solution": "We wish to construct an event with probability $\\frac{2}{5}$ for heads (H) and $\\frac{3}{5}$ for tails (T).  To do this rigorously, we rely on a rejection-sampling method that uses repeated flips of our fair coins until a suitable configuration appears.  We outline a thorough argument as follows: First, observe that we need to form outcomes that occur with probability $\\frac{2}{5}$ and $\\frac{3}{5}$ using unbiased flips that individually yield heads or tails with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ each.  Notice that $\\frac{2}{5}$ is difficult to create by a single fixed number of coin tosses, because the total number of equally likely outcomes for N coin tosses is $2^N$, and $2/5$ is not generally a fraction of the form K/$2^N$ for small N.  Hence, we use a standard rejection scheme.  Specifically, flip your coins sufficiently many times to get a uniform selection from a set with a size that is at least 5.  For example, flip three coins (or equivalently, flip two coins multiple times until you generate three fair coin bits).  This gives us 8 equally likely outcomes, corresponding to numbers 0 through 7 in binary.  Label the outcomes 0 through 7.  If your outcome is in the set ${0,1,2,3,4}$, then keep it, interpreting each of those five possibilities as a distinct number 1 through 5 with equal probability $\\frac{1}{5}$.  If the outcome is in ${5,6,7}$, discard it and repeat the entire three-coin-flips step.  This ensures that whenever you do keep a result, you have a uniform integer from 1 to 5.  Next, choose outcomes 1 and 2 to correspond to 'heads' and outcomes 3, 4, and 5 to correspond to 'tails.'  Consequently, whenever you accept a result, 'heads' happens with probability $\\frac{2}{5}$ and 'tails' with probability $\\frac{3}{5}$.  By discarding (and reflipping) any outcome not in ${0,1,2,3,4}$, we enforce that every accepted sample achieves exactly a 2:3 ratio for H:T.  This process is well-defined and will terminate eventually with probability 1, thus guaranteeing a perfect $\\frac{2}{5}$ chance of heads and $\\frac{3}{5}$ chance of tails, all using only fair coin flips.  The justification is that each flip sequence is independent, and the repeated rejection does not affect the relative probabilities on the accepted set.", "valid answer": "Valid Answers: Provide any valid rejection-sampling or equivalent procedure yielding Heads with probability $\\frac{2}{5}$ and Tails with probability $\\frac{3}{5}$. \\", "problem tags": ["Probability", "Coin Flips", "Rejection Sampling"], "problem difficulty": "Medium", "problem hint": "Think about uniformly generating an integer from 1 to 5 by flipping coins, then assigning two of those outcomes to 'heads' and three to 'tails.'
